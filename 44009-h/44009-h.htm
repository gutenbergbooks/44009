on the
Assassination of President Kennedy</a></h2>

<hr />
<h2 id="pmr">TESTIMONY OF PAUL M. RAIGORODSKY</h2>

<p>The testimony of Paul M. Raigorodsky was taken at 11:15 a.m., on March 31,
1964, in his office, First National Bank Building, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Albert E.
Jenner, Jr., assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Raigorodsky, do you swear that in the testimony you are
about to give, you will tell the truth, and nothing but the truth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Miss Oliver, this is Paul M. Raigorodsky, whose office is in the
First National Bank Building, Dallas, room 522, and who resides in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. At the Stoneleigh Hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who resides at the Stoneleigh Hotel in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. Raigorodsky, I am Albert E. Jenner, Jr., of the legal staff of the Warren
Commission, and Mr. Robert T. Davis, who is also present, is the assistant
attorney general of the State of Texas and is serving on the staff of the Texas
Court of Inquiry. The Commission and the attorney general's office of Texas
are cooperating in their respective investigations.</p>

<p>The Commission was authorized by Senate Joint Resolution 137 of the U.S.
Congress and was then created by President Lyndon B. Johnson by Executive
Order 11130 and its members appointed by him. The Commission has adopted
rules and regulations regarding the taking of depositions. The Commission
to investigate all the circumstances of the assassination of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>We have some information that you are particularly well acquainted with
the overall so-called Russian emigre community in Dallas, and you are an old
time Dallasite, and while frankly we do not expect you to have any direct
information as to the assassination, today, we think you do have some information
that might help us with respect to&mdash;using the vernacular&mdash;cast of characters,
people who touched the lives of Lee Harvey Oswald and Marina Oswald, as
the case might be, and as I understand it you appear voluntarily to assist us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Oh, sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Helping out in any fashion your information may assist us in
that regard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think it will be well if you, in your own words, gave us your
general background, just give us your general background&mdash;when you came to
Texas and in general what your business experience has been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. My background?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Well, commencing&mdash;I don't know where to start, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, where were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. I was born in Russia, I lived in Russia until I was, oh, let's
see, I escaped from Russia in 1919, went to Czechoslovakia to the university there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did what, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. I went to the university there and I am escaping from
Russia&mdash;I fought against the Bolsheviks in two different armies and then came
to the United States with the help of the American Red Cross and the YMCA.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. In December&mdash;the 28th, 1920.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1940?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. 1920.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How old are you, by the way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Sixty-five&mdash;exactly.</p>

<p>May I have this not on the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>(Discussion between Counsel Jenner and the witness off the record at this
point.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Well, I came to this country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In 1920?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes; and they told me that for the money that they advanced
for me to travel, that we only have to serve in the United States for
some capacity, so when I came in, I enlisted in the Air Force and was sent to
Camp Travis, Texas, and then in 1922 I received an honorable discharge, and
because it was I enlisted in time of war, I became full-fledged citizen in 4 months
after I arrived to this country. We still were at war with Germany, the peace
hadn't been signed. And then I went to the University of Texas in 1922 and
graduated in 1924.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What degree?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Civil Engineering. That's all they were giving, even though
my specialty is petroleum engineering, but I took courses in different subjects.</p>

<p>By the way, first, I speak with accent and second, I speak with colds, and you
can stop me any time and I will be glad to repeat.</p>

<p>And, that was in 1924&mdash;then I went to work in Los Angeles, Calif. I simultaneously
married and that was in 1924. I married Ethel Margaret McCaleb,
whose father was with Federal Reserve Bank&mdash;a Governor or whatever you
call it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Federal Reserve Bank?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. It was here in Dallas under Wilson in 1918&mdash;he was appointed.
At that time he was a banker and was organizing banks. Then, I
stayed in California for some&mdash;from 1924 until more or less&mdash;until 1928. I
worked as an engineer with E. Forrest Gilmore Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that a Dallas concern?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. No; that was a California concern, specializing in the
building of gasoline plants and refineries. Then, I worked for Newton Process
Manufacturing Co. and for Signal Oil and Gas Co.&mdash;just, that is, progressive&mdash;you
see, it was going from one to another, getting higher pay and things like that,
and then in 1928 the Newton Process Manufacturing Co. was sold out and three
of us, I was at that time chief process engineer, and the other man was chief
construction engineer, and the third one was chief operational engineer&mdash;we
organized a company called Engineering Research and Equipment Co., and we
started to build gasoline plants and refineries. Then, I was sent to Dallas
because our business was good&mdash;I was sent to Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your business was growing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Oh, yes; growing. I was sent to Dallas and I organized
an office here. Then, we moved the company from Dallas and made the Los
Angeles office a branch office. Then, I went to Tulsa and opened an office of our
company there, and that way we were building lots of plants in Louisiana, in
Texas, in Oklahoma. Then, I sold out my third in 1929. It was a good time to
sell out, and I organized the Petroleum Engineering Co., which company I have
had ever since, until just now&mdash;it is inoperative.</p>

<p>Then, I continued to&mdash;I opened an office in Houston and continued to build
gasoline plants and refineries under the name of Petroleum Engineering Co. and
built about 250 of them all over the world and in the United States&mdash;lots of
them&mdash;even in Russia, though I never went there, we had a protocol (I believe
No. 4), under which we were supposed to have given them some refineries and
gasoline plants&mdash;you know the "chickens and the eggs" situation. The fact is I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
had an order from the Treasury Department and one of them was sunk. Maybe
this should be off the record?</p>

<p>(Discussion between Counsel Jenner and the witness off the record at this
point.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Let's see, now, Pearl Harbor was in 1939?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1941; December of 1941.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. 1941?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. 1941.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. December 8th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. The war started in 1939.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The Germans invaded Poland in September 1939.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Already then we had the War Production Board, though to
begin with it was the Defense Board, and then War Production Board, but I was
asked to come to Washington. Now, let's see, which year was it? Probably
1941&mdash;before the war.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Before the war with Japan, you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Before Pearl Harbor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. I was asked to come to Washington to organize the Department
of Natural Gas and Natural Gasoline Industries for the United States,
which I did, and then I had to open&mdash;I worked under DeGolyer. I organized
the Department from nothing until I had five offices. We had districts in
California and Tulsa and Chicago, Houston and New York, and then in 1943 I
resigned, and in the meantime I got ulcer, you know, working like you do, until
11:30 nights, so in 1943 I resigned and came back to my business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Here in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. No, in Houston. At that time I officed in Houston. By the
way, while I was building plants for others, I also built plants for myself for
the production of motor fuel, L.P.G. and other pipeline products, and the first plant
was built in 1936&mdash;the Glen Rose Gasoline Co. The second one was built in
1943&mdash;the Claiborne Gasoline Co. Then, I lived in Houston until about 1949
or 1950 and I got sick with my back. You know, I have a very bad back. They
wanted to operate on me there but Jake Hamon here, a friend of mine, told
me that he wouldn't speak to me unless I come to Dallas, so believe or not,
they brought me to Dallas.</p>

<p>That's very interesting what I am going to tell you&mdash;in an ambulance from
Houston&mdash;and there was a Dr. Paul Williams&mdash;he told me that without operation
he would put me on my feet. I never went back to Houston, even to close my
apartment or to close my office, but I moved my apartment and my offices here to
Dallas and I offered people that worked with me, that I would pay them for whatever
loss they had, because in selling their houses and moving here, lock, stock and
barrel, I never went back. I was so mad, and I have lived here ever since with
one exception. I believe it was in 1952&mdash;in 1952 I was asked by&mdash;you know
General Anderson, by any chance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. He was what we call&mdash;there was an organization in Europe
called SRE, Special Representatives to Europe. There was an Ambassador
Draper at the head of it, and Ambassador Anderson is a Deputy, and in 1952
Ambassador Anderson asked me to come to Europe and help them with production,
so I went to Europe to improve the production of tanks, planes,
ammunition, et cetera for all the NATO countries.</p>

<p>I was Deputy Director of Production. Now, I think I was getting along all
right and again I got sick in my neck this time, so they flew me&mdash;they flew me
to Johns Hopkins and found out that I had bad neck. By the way, I'm not
supposed to have this, but here is my card.</p>

<p>(Handed instrument to Counsel Jenner.)</p>

<p>I left in such a hurry, they flew me under such pain, that I didn't return
anything, and I had to start to destroy most of the things, and I didn't destroy
this one. I stayed there for several months and then I came back here and
I have been here ever since, living here, going to different places, going to
Europe and I made trips to Europe, Tahiti, Jamaica, and finally bought a plantation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
in Jamaica together with some other friends here and we organized a club
called Tryall, T-r-y-a-l-l [spelling] Golf Club, and I go there every year now.
That's about all. My wife divorced me in 1943 for the primary reason that I
wouldn't retire. I have two daughters, one is Mrs. Harry Bridges. That has
nothing to do with <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With the Longshoremen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That has nothing to do with the Longshoremen. And off
the record now.</p>

<p>(Discussion between Counsel Jenner and the witness off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. In fact, I just came from the wedding. That's the second
marriage. Then, I have another daughter&mdash;maybe you know my son-in-law,
Howard Norris?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Where is he&mdash;in Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Howard Lee Norris, he graduated, I think, in 1951 or 1952.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, I don't think so. What business is he in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Lawyer of the University of Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. I am very proud of that. That's my child.</p>

<p>(At this point the witness exhibited wedding pictures to Counsel Jenner.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is your daughter on the left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes. And, I will answer anything else you want to now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. While living in the Dallas area, and I listened to your
splendid career, I assume that&mdash;and if this assumption is wrong, please correct
me&mdash;that the people of Russian descent who came into this area of Texas would
tend to seek your advice or assistance, that you in turn voluntarily, on your own
part, had an interest in those people in the community and that in any event
you became acquainted with a good many people from Europe who settled in
this general area&mdash;in the Dallas metropolitan area and even up into Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes&mdash;Louise, will you get me my church file?</p>

<p>(Addressing his secretary, Mrs. Louise Meek.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Will you be good enough to tell me first, and Mr. Davis, in general
of the usual&mdash;if there is a usual pattern of someone coming in here? How
they become acquainted? What is the community of people of Russian descent,
and I do want to tell you in advance that the thought I have in mind in this
connection is trying to follow the Oswalds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What would be the common manner and fashion in which the
Oswalds would become acquainted, or others would become acquainted with
them, and before you get to that, that's kind of a specific, I want you to give
me from your fund of knowledge and your interests&mdash;tell me what your interests
have been, what the expected pattern would be of people coming&mdash;like
Marina Oswald, for example, into this community?</p>

<p>Let's not make it Marina Oswald&mdash;I don't want to get into a specific, but
let's take a hypothetical couple?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. All right. I can just summarize what happened in the
many years that I have been both in Houston and in Dallas.</p>

<p>There are methods of, I would say, of immigration into the communities in
Dallas of the Russians I'm talking about. One is via friendship, acquaintanceship
somewhere in Europe or in China or somewhere else, but with different
Russians and the order by the Tolstoy Foundation&mdash;you are acquainted with
the Tolstoy Fund?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think for the purposes of the record, since the reader may
not be acquainted with it, that you might help a little bit on the Tolstoy
Foundation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Well, Miss Alexandra Tolstoy is a daughter of our great
novelist, Leo Tolstoy, and I guess you know him, and she came to this country
and she organized a Tolstoy Foundation, which takes care of Russian refugees
throughout the world wherever they may be. They process them, which means
that they know all about them before they come into here through their own
organization or your different organizations. Like, you have a church in the
United States&mdash;you have a church organization or all kinds of benevolent
organizations that want to help refugees and they don't know who to help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
so they go to the Tolstoy Foundation and therefore the Tolstoy Foundation is
able to place many, many Russians in this country, not only in this country
but&mdash;I am on the Board of Directors of the Tolstoy Foundation&mdash;but also in
European countries. Sometimes they cannot bring them to the United States,
not enough money perhaps. Now, anybody who comes to the Tolstoy Foundation,
you know right off of the bat they have been checked, rechecked and double
checked. There is no question about them. I mean, that's the No. 1 stamp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's the No. 1 stamp of an approval or of their genuineness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Of approval&mdash;in fact, the U.S. Government recognized that
and has been up until about a year or two ago giving the Tolstoy Foundation
as much as $400,000 a year subsidy for this kind of work.</p>

<p>Now, of the other Russians that come here, as I said, they come in through
acquaintanceship&mdash;most of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They come because of prior acquaintanceship?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. With some.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With some people who are here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's right&mdash;correspondence you see. Like we have in
Houston&mdash;we had a bunch of people coming from Serbia, you know, Yugoslavia&mdash;the
few we have that left Russia and went to Yugoslavia and then they had
to escape Yugoslavia, and there was quite a Russian colony there and some
of them drifted to the United States and settled in Houston, and of course they
start correspondence and working and lots of other people came to Houston and
to Dallas through that channel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They followed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Then, there is a small bunch of Russians that appear from
nowhere. I mean, they don't come with any approval from Tolstoy Foundation
or do they come through the acquaintanceship of people here. They just drift
and there's no place, believe me, in the world where you cannot find one Russian.
Now, I would like this off the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion between Counsel Jenner and the witness off the record at this
point.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, let's have this on the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Now, because of my&mdash;I always believe that even though
I am, myself, not much of a churchgoing man, but I believe that the only way
to unite Russians, and I think they should be united in this country, was through
a church, so, for many years we had a church in Texas&mdash;at Galveston&mdash;but that
church&mdash;we didn't like because the Serbian priest, they were coming over there.
We couldn't figure it out, whether they were one side of the fence or the other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. One side of what fence or the other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Well, the only fence I know of is between the communism
and the anticommunism.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. You are on the anticommunistic side of the fence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Oh; of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I want that to appear on record is why I asked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Oh, yes; I have been all my life. So, let's see, maybe in
1949 or thereabouts&mdash;I have donated quite a bit of money to the Russian
colony in Houston there with the understanding that if they would secure at
least 50 percent of additional money from the rest of the people of the Russian
colony, that they buy or build a church there, which they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What religion is that&mdash;the name of the church?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Russian&mdash;Greek Orthodox. You may call it also Eastern
Greek Orthodox. It's the same religion as Greek Catholics have with two main
differences&mdash;one is the language in which the service is performed is the old
Slavic languages against Greek, and then, of course, we have our own Patriarch
at the head of our own church.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Oh, no, no; we have in New York&mdash;it's Metropolitan Anastasia,
who is the head of our church of this country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who was the pastor over in Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Well, I will come to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Then, when we got to&mdash;when I came to Dallas we had
Father Royster here of the church, I mean, he is a convert. He is an American
convert to the Greek Orthodox religion and he approached me because he
wanted to build the Church of St. Seraphim in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You must be acquainted with Father Royster?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. He knows me very well, but anyhow, here it is about the
church <span class="locked">here&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The full name is Dimitri Robert Royster&mdash;go right ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. (Handed instrument to Counsel Jenner.) That gives us
the history of the situation here, but then we had a split here between the
Russians who came to this country escaping the Communists or Bolsheviks, at
that time we called them&mdash;they called themselves the Guard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The original church that you helped organize, that is referred
to as the Old Guard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's right, and St. Seraphim you see, because we both
occupy the same premises and I was the head of both of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were the head of both churches?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Oh, yes; I belong to both churches. In fact I belong to
three churches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They are different parishes in the same church, aren't they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. No, they are entirely different churches. I would like to
explain to you&mdash;you see, in this country&mdash;I'm quite sure you know&mdash;I don't know
whether you would be interested in what I am going to tell you about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am primarily interested in this&mdash;from the depositions I have
taken and inquiries I have made, my impression is that one of the immediate
sources of obtaining acquaintanceship in the community by refugees who come
here is through the church.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. St. Seraphim's is one parish and then there is another one&mdash;George
Bouhe's folks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or the church he is most active in, and I forget the name of that
one&mdash;what is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's St. Nicholas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's the St. Nicholas Church?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. I'm head of that one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are head of that one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you say it is a third one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. No, it is not a third one here&mdash;just the two. Now you see,
this is the thing I have to tell you then, because that is, again, leads to the
same Oswald situation, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. You see, the Father Royster Church is not just for Russians.
It is for all the Greek Orthodox, whether they are Serbians, Sicilians,
or Lebanese&mdash;and there are lots of people that came for the same religion even
though their services in their own churches is in their own language, but here
they are all in the English language because of Father Royster's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Father Royster preaches the sermons in English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Oh, yes; there is no question he is an American, he was a
teacher at S.M.U. until he resigned. Now, I am a member of this church
because it is a Greek Orthodox and I want to help them&mdash;that means I pay
my dues and I help them with everything they need, in fact, we have a monastery
there&mdash;that's the one which Father Royster organized of which also I helped
them. Now, the difference between Father Royster's Church and Bouhe's
Church, as you know <span class="locked">it&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. St. Nicholas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. St. Nicholas&mdash;so that Father Royster belongs to Metropolitan
Leonty&mdash;Metropolitan Leonty is in New York, and if you may say so,
he is a competitor of Metropolitan Anastasia. Metropolitan Leonty is the head
of the American Russian Church. You see, before the revolution, we had a
church in America, and he was the head of it. Metropolitan Anastasia is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
head of the Russians outside of Russia, because he is&mdash;whether he escaped
Russia like all of us&mdash;therefore, all of us who escaped with him or about the
same time belonged to that church.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. It is very simple, and as far as I am concerned it is the
better method, because we know each other, we know about each other, we
know which fought, which one fought against the Bolsheviks&mdash;all of the so-called
St. Nicholas Church is an old anti-Communist group&mdash;period.</p>

<p>Now, the St. Seraphim Church can be infiltrated by anybody because nobody
checks, you see, the only thing and there is no tie-in there except for the
church&mdash;not that there is a tie-in because we fought against communism and
because of the church. The same thing in Houston, the tie-in was not only
because of the church but because we fought against communism and even
though we came through different grounds, some through New York, some
through California, but we got there and so we have a church over there.</p>

<p>Now, I personally believe that a church is a church&mdash;as long as it is my
religion. I will go to one or I will go to another one. It doesn't make any
difference to me&mdash;I tried to get them together and I didn't succeed in that town.
In Houston&mdash;I think that is because it is only one church&mdash;it is more successful.</p>

<p>Now, I don't know it for a fact, but except as I was told by Father Royster
that the Oswalds came through Fort Worth originally. Now, this is hearsay&mdash;that
I believe they got acquainted with the people by the name of Clark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Max Clark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. I mean, that's all hearsay&mdash;I do not know it for a fact.
While she is a Russian, in fact she is a first cousin of a very close friend of
mine, Prince Sherbatoff, who lives in New York and lives in Jamaica. That's
where I see him occasionally. Now, it is my understanding that the Clarks
told some of their friends&mdash;again, this is hearsay, that "Here is a Russian
married to an American and they don't even have milk for the babies." Now,
that is my understanding. And so, the Russians, I mean of both churches,
because there are not many Russians in our church as against another, started
to provide them groceries, buy milk for the baby, in fact I was told that they
had her fix her teeth&mdash;her teeth were absolutely, oh, it is unspeakable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This would, from your observation, be a perfectly normal sort
of thing that would occur in this community through the churches that you
have mentioned. They are small churches, the people are well acquainted
with all the parishioners, that is, acquainted with each other. They seek to
help?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Absolutely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They seek to help those who come from Europe as refugees or
otherwise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Those of Russian or Serbian or Central European derivation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's right&mdash;that's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About when was the first you heard of hearsay or otherwise
<span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That that happened that way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No, of the Oswalds at all? When did it first come to your
attention that the Oswalds were here in the Dallas-Fort Worth area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. The assassination. I am absolutely ignorant of their
names&mdash;I never saw them before the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I appreciate that&mdash;had you heard of the Oswald name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. No, never had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Prior to November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. No, in fact, I have heard a Russian discussing those things
which I tell you are hearsay with me, on a meeting&mdash;we have yearly meetings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you say yearly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Once a year&mdash;we meet to elect officers. We meet once a
year to elect the officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is this true of both St. Nicholas and St. Seraphim?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. It's St. Nicholas. In St. Seraphim I do not attend to
any kind of administrative duties. I am just a parishioner, now, because,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
first of all, I believe that sooner or later all of us will die in the other church
and there will be nothing left but St. Seraphim. First, because St. Seraphim
Church is growing. Well, if there are one or two of us left&mdash;it would be fine.
You see, how we are at St. Nicholas&mdash;we are supposed to meet once a month
and we are supposed to have the priest from Houston come here and perform
services, but now Houston doesn't have the priest and so we don't have the
priest. So, our priest from Galveston comes up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Comes up here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. And I personally don't like him&mdash;so I wouldn't go to the
services in my own church on his account.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Now, I went to New York and I discussed with our people
from our Synod, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The Synod, S-y-n-o-d (spelling)?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. And they are sending us a priest, a new priest, who will
be stationed in Houston and then they come here once a month, but the Houston
community is down to about 15 families and this is not any better. We have
about 10 families, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you say different&mdash;you mean here in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. In Dallas&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is the name of the priest who comes up from Galveston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Let me see&mdash;maybe I have it here.</p>

<p>(Examining file.)</p>

<p>Maybe he's not from Galveston&mdash;he comes from Houston, but he's the one
that was, you know,&mdash;can this be off the record&mdash;I just throw those notices in
the waste basket because I don't want to hear from him.</p>

<p>(Discussion between Counsel Jenner and the Witness off the record at this
point.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Miss Oliver, Mr. Raigorodsky has handed me a one-sheet document,
single spaced, typed, entitled "Some Historical Information Concerning
St. Seraphim Eastern Orthodox Church," which I have perused, and in view
of the testimony of previous witnesses regarding the organization of St. Seraphim's
Church and their attendance at its services, and our parishioners who
have some contact through the church, or at least because of their acquaintance
with other parishioners, and in turn with the Oswalds, it would be helpful to
have this statement in the record, and will you please copy it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. You can have that&mdash;I have a photostat of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I want to copy it in the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. All right. "Some Historical Information Concerning St.
Seraphim Eastern Orthodox Church."</p>

<p>In April of 1954, a small group of converts to the Orthodox Faith (Rev.
Ilya Rudolph Rangel, rector of the already existing Mexican Orthodox Church
under the jurisdiction of Bishop Bogdan, Dimitri Robert Royster, a subdeacon in
Bishop Bogdan's jurisdiction, and Miss Dimitra Royster) sought permission
of their bishop to organize an English-language Orthodox mission in the city
of Dallas. It may be stated parenthetically that the three above-mentioned persons
were working, at the time of the organization of St. Seraphim's, in close
cooperation with St. Nicholas Russian Orthodox Church, of which Father Alexander
Chernay of Houston was pastor and which held services periodically in
the chapel of the Sunday School building at St. Matthew's Episcopal Cathedral.</p>

<p>Father Rangel and Subdeacon Royster set out to find a building that would
be suitable to house the activities of the projected mission. Property was located
at the corner of McKinney Avenue (3734) and Blackburn Street. The
sale price of the property was $15,000, and since the financial resources of the
organizers were limited, Father Rangel and Subdeacon Royster went to seek the
aid of Mr. Paul Raigorodsky, a member of St. Nicholas' Parish. Mr. Raigorodsky
agreed to make it possible for the group to acquire a loan from the
First National Bank in Dallas in order to purchase the property (on which
there was an eight-room two-story house). The property was bought in the
name of St. Seraphim's Church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
Services in English began to be held in June of 1954. Father Rangel conducted
occasional services&mdash;Sunday Vespers weekly and an early Liturgy once
a month. Father Rangel and Subdeacon Royster constructed an iconostas and
made a number of shrines and articles, and a chapel was arranged on the first
floor of the house. After a month or 2 the members of St. Nicholas' Parish
were invited to use the chapel, since one of their members had been so instrumental
in the acquisition of the property.</p>

<p>On November 6, 1954, Subdeacon Royster was ordained to the priesthood by
Bishop Bogdan and became rector of St. Seraphim's Church. Shortly afterwards,
it was agreed to transfer the title of the property at 3734 McKinney to
St. Nicholas' Church. It was further agreed that the two groups would use
the chapel, St. Nicholas' Church 1 weekend per month and St. Seraphim's Church
the rest of the time.</p>

<p>In January of 1955 an extensive renovation program was undertaken, and
both floors of the house were redecorated, sheet-rocked and painted.</p>

<p>Father Hilarion Madison had been ordained by Bishop Bogdan on October 31,
1954, and had worked with Father Rangel as assistant pastor at the Mexican
Church until December 1954, when he joined the work at St. Seraphim's and
became assistant to Father Royster.</p>

<p>For a few months joint services were held on the occasions when Father
Alexander Chernay visited Dallas; that is, Father Dimitri and Father Hilarion
concelebrated with Father Alexander.</p>

<p>In March 1955, Bishop Bogdan directed Father Dimitri and Father Hilarion
to begin mission work in Fort Worth, taking advantage of the weekends when
Father Alexander was in Dallas, in order to extend the benefits of the missionary
activity to a group of Orthodox residents of that city. Services were held in
the chapel of St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in downtown Fort Worth until the
summer of 1956.</p>

<p>In order better to pursue its mission as an English-language parish and to
attract orthodox people of all national backgrounds, St. Seraphim's Church
decided to acquire property of its own. A house was bought at 4203 Newton
Avenue, and a chapel, meeting room, office and kitchen were arranged in the
house after considerable renovation. This building served the needs of the
parish until the new church was built in March and April of 1961. The house
was then converted into a parish hall. In 1962, an adjacent lot with its house
were bought by the parish. The house is being renovated at present and will
eventually be used for a rectory.</p>

<p>In September of 1958 the parish was transferred from the jurisdiction of
Bishop Bogdan to that of Metropolitan Leonty, the Russian Metropolia.</p>

<p>Membership in St. Seraphim's parish has grown from the original 3 to
approximately 125 souls. Average attendance at the Sunday Liturgy has increased
year by year and is now about 75. A Sunday School with two classes
is maintained. Services are held regularly on Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday
evenings, and the Liturgy is celebrated on Sundays and on holy days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Raigorodsky, in that connection, this document which is
entitled "Some Historical Information Concerning St. Seraphim Eastern Orthodox
Church," when was that prepared?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. I have no idea because I have&mdash;let's see&mdash;the early part of
this year I have asked Father Royster if he has anything historical about the
St. Seraphim, how it started and everything, or can he prepare something,
and he said "No," he already had something, and I said, "All right, send me
a copy of it."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you understand that Father Royster prepared this historical
summary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's my understanding.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, have you read this historical summary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Oh, yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, are you familiar with the events and course of events that
are recited in that 1-page summary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And to the best of your knowledge and information, does Father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
Royster, if he prepared it or whomever prepared it, is the recital reasonably
accurate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Well, I'll say it's reasonably accurate except it does not
give the actual reason for the split of the churches. You see, here he said:</p>

<p>"In order better to pursue its mission," as a native language parish, "and
to attract orthodox people of all national backgrounds, St. Seraphim's Church
decided to acquire property of its own."</p>

<p>Well, that's not the reason&mdash;the reason is that we couldn't get along together,
you see, and there was a constant fight between the two churches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, the factions split primarily, as I understand your testimony
today, over the Father Royster group, and I use that expression not to tag him,
well, I'll say the St. Nicholas Church, that would possibly be better, because
Father Royster preached in the English language.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And in the St. Nicholas Church or parish the services were said
in what language, again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. In the old Slavic language. That's not the principal reason
either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then, another reason is that the organizers of the St. Nicholas
Church were, as you have said, labeled "Old Guard" in the sense that they were
composed primarily of those people of Russian origin and other Slavic origins
who in Europe <span class="locked">fought&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Either fought or escaped.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Fought the Communists or Bolsheviks or escaped from their
regime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes&mdash;because there are lots of women and children over
there, you see, they never fought against them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; there are a lot of ladies, of course, who did not fight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And because of that common experience they tended to stay
together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's right&mdash;more closely knit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. More closely knit and they had a preference for the use of the
basic language, and that group organized the St. Nicholas Church.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. St. Nicholas was organized to begin with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then, you tended to support it and you have supported it and
you are more active in that Church?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are more active by far, in fact, you are an officer of that
group, are you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes; I am president.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are president of that group, but you are a member of the
other parish or the other church and you assist it financially as a parishioner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there anything else in the 1-page summary prepared or given
to you by Father Royster that you would like to comment upon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I would like to ask&mdash;did we ever get to the real reason for the split
of the church?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. I just made a statement a while ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I didn't understand&mdash;what was the reason that the church
was split?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Well, they just couldn't get along together. I mean, it's
purely personality.</p>

<p>You see, Father Royster at that time&mdash;that's the main point&mdash;Father Royster
doesn't mean anything to you or to me, but to lots of Russians it means everything.
You see, Father Royster at that time belonged to the Ukraine branch
of the church. You see, he couldn't get ordained, but then he tried to, and
I tried to help him to be ordained by Metropolitan and Anastasia, but he
couldn't fulfill the requirements so he tried to get in through Metropolitan
Leonty. He couldn't quite get in because of their requirements, but they suggested
that he will be ordained by the Russian Ukranian Church, of which
Father Joseph Bogdan, B-o-g-d-a-n [spelling] had the jurisdiction of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
Ukranian branch of Metropolitan Leonty's branch of the Russian Church in
this country, and so, you see, and that was&mdash;now, we have to go back through
the basic facts that Russians and Ukranians have never gotten along together,
and in fact, Ukranians were separative&mdash;they wanted to separate from the
rest of the Russians and he will have their church to become part of their
parish. That was just going against the grain of every Russian.</p>

<p>Now, all those things tended to create dissatisfaction and fights, I mean verbal
fights, of course&mdash;no physical violence of any kind, but verbal fights, and
Father Royster decided to pull out and he asked me if I would help him, and
I said, "Sure, as long as it is a Greek Orthodox Church," and that's how it
happened.</p>

<p>You see, some of the statements&mdash;like he said, "In September of 1958 the
parish was transferred from the jurisdiction of Bishop Bogdan to that of
Metropolitan Leonty, the Russian Metropolia."</p>

<p>Well, he is Russian Metropolia, but it isn't finished&mdash;in this country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The words "in this country" should be added there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes; in the United States. I mean, those are minor, but
substantially, it is correct&mdash;what he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With those explanations, Miss Oliver, will you please copy the
historical statement into the record?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Reporter</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>(The instrument referred to is set forth on pp. 8 and 9 of this volume.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. These differences of opinion, historical, religious, and otherwise,
and arguments rather than facts, tend to affect also the views of an individual
who is a member of St. Nicholas Church with respect to individuals who
regularly attended St. Seraphim's?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Well, it's a peculiar thing that the people, as I understand
it, who helped Mrs. Oswald, were people from St. Nicholas Church.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Largely?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. So&mdash;I don't know how that came about&mdash;perhaps she is
Russian. I can understand so much&mdash;she is a Russian and St. Nicholas is
Russian and St. Seraphim is Eastern Orthodox.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did I understand you correctly, sir, that the parishioners, by
and large, of St. Nicholas are exclusively anti-Communists?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. There's no question about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Because of the history, there's no question about it&mdash;largely?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Largely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There are other reasons, but that substantially is one major
motivating force?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And while they would be interested in assisting persons who
are of Russian birth, who would come into this community, would they also be
interested in ascertaining at least what they thought might be the political
views of someone who came fresh from Russia, with in turn the thought in
mind that if that person or persons or family in their opinion had some affiliation
with or even sympathetic to what we in America call the Communists in
control of Russia, that these people in St. Nicholas would have an aversion to
them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Correct. You see, he asked the question you are getting
to&mdash;that is the first time I heard she was Russian&mdash;they told me they were
interrogated by different branches of the Government and that is the first
time they told me that they know of Marina Oswald, how they helped her
and everything else and I asked them&mdash;"How did it happen?" Now, she went to
the church to have her child christened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She went to St. Nicholas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. No; St. Seraphim's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that caused what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That caused them to think and to know, as they understood
it, that she did it practically at the peril of her life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She did what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. She did it at the peril of her <span class="locked">life&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean they objected?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Because he told her she cannot do that, she had to sneak
out with that child to be christened and since Communists are atheists, they
knew that she could not possibly be Communists.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You heard afterwards that Marina had had her child baptized
in St. Seraphim's?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And those persons then in your church, the St. Nicholas Church,
cited that as being a fact which led them to believe that she believed in the
Lord and was therefore not an atheist, that it was a factor that led them in
turn to believe that she was not a Communist, because Communists are atheists?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whereas, you accepted that as a factor to consider, but there
occurred to you a countervailing consideration, which <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Correct&mdash;which was that the Communists may have been&mdash;if
it was a conspiracy, that would to me have been the best way to get into the
good graces of the Russian Church community.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Lead people to believe that you were a Christian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And not an atheist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And seek by that stratagem to gain their confidence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So that that factor, whatever it was, had to be examined and
held in abeyance so you wouldn't jump to a conclusion from that one thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. You see&mdash;I don't trust them in any kind of a condition or
any kind of a statement that they make. It doesn't make any difference, but
in fact, I know it isn't truthful&mdash;it's just like Mr. Gromyko lying to President
Kennedy sitting in his office, you know, lying just like a trooper and then knowing
that it wasn't so, but he lied. I don't have to tell you all about what Communists
do and how they operate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did there in due course come into this community a man by the
name of George De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were here when he came here, were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Well, let's say that I met George De Mohrenschildt in
Dallas while I was coming here, just&mdash;you know&mdash;just occasionally to see my
friends, probably about, I'll say 15 or 17 years ago, somewhere in that neighborhood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you heard of him prior to that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes; I heard of him through Jake Hamon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Through Mr. Hamon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Hamon, H-a-m-o-n [spelling]&mdash;Jake.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. He is an oilman friend of mine here, quite well known,
and he told me there was a Russian here&mdash;do I know him, and I said, "No; I
hadn't heard about him." That's how I met him&mdash;at a party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are talking about George De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In this 17-year period from that initial acquaintance to the
present time, had you come to know George De Mohrenschildt and acquire some
knowledge of his origin and background?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please recite it to us&mdash;who is he, what is his history,
his marriages, the nativity of the ladies he married and some of his activities,
leaving until a little bit later in the questioning the business associations or
contacts you may have had with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Well, from what I understand, George De Mohrenschildt
comes from what we call by-the-Baltic Germans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is&mdash;by-the-Baltic Germans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. The by-the-Baltic Germans are Germans that lived by the
Baltic Sea and they were Russians or rather, Russiafied Germans and they were
in the service of the Czar for generations and generations and were considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Russians. Most of them were barons, you know, and I don't know whether
George's family were or not, but the "de" Mohrenschildt signifies that his family
had a title.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's the "de"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. The "de"&mdash;yes; it signifies that. Now, I understand that
he has a friend or his brother is teaching, I believe, at the University of Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that the University of Chicago or Dartmouth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Dartmouth, or the University of Chicago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. It might be, now, but at that time when I first learned it&mdash;he
was at the University of Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And his first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you say his first name was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I thought you gave it to me the other day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Maybe I could get it from some other source?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. No&mdash;not from me. Now, when I first knew George he
was an engineer in charge of the operations of the Rangley Field in Colorado.
Then, he quit the job and went into the business of his own, which was supposed
to be a consultant petroleum engineer and oil operator.</p>

<p>He was married, as far as I know, three times. I didn't know his first wife,
but I know his daughter by the first wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is her name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. I don't remember; I'm sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you have met her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Oh, yes; they live here at the Maple Terrace, which is
next door to the Stoneleigh Hotel. The second wife was&mdash;that's where this
was when he married the second time&mdash;it was to a daughter of the Sharples,
S-h-a-r-p-l-e-s [spelling].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was her name Wynne, W-y-n-n-e [spelling]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. No; we called her something else&mdash;it will come to me&mdash;just
leave that blank. They had two children, both of them were spastic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was a boy and a girl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's right. One of them since died.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The boy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. The boy. The son is still alive, and it's my understanding
that his second wife divorced and she had to pay him, as I understand it,
$30,000. Of course, you have the records.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Then, there were two trusts set for the children and when
one of the children died, George De Mohrenschildt wanted to claim the trust
in his name and that was a fight which went to the courts, but at the request
of some of the friends of Mrs. De Mohrenschildt and my friends, I called George
and told him that if he pursues his suit, that his name will be mud and he
can never come back to Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How would that be enforced? You mean never come back to
Dallas and join this Russian community?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. And be a member, <span class="locked">because&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A member of what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Of the social group that they were here originally. You
see, he took it differently when I called him. I can tell you it was a hornet's
nest is what it was. Anyhow, he withdrew the suit&mdash;whether I did it or for
some other reason, but I think Mrs. Crespi can give you more information than
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Mrs. Crespi, C-r-e-s-p-i [spelling]. She is the one who
asked me to intervene if I can. I believe I could have at that time because
George owed me a little money, frankly, and he has been borrowing from me
occasionally, always repaid, but it took a long time. The last time he borrowed
he repaid very quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The last time he borrowed was it a substantial amount?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. No; $500.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was divorced from the Sharples girl whose first name you
can't recall at the moment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Isn't that funny?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he then, let's see, that was the second wife; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he married a third time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. A third time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is that his present wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And who is she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's a <span class="locked">question&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does the name J-h-a-n-a [spelling] or Jeanne serve your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Jean&mdash;Jean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. His present wife is named Jeanne?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes&mdash;Jeanne.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What do you know about her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Well, I don't know anything about her except that she
was a successful dress designer, I believe, in California, and that she had, and
I may say it frankly, that she had a low opinion of our form of government.
I don't know whether she is a Communist, Socialist, Anarchist or what.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What are her views with respect <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Didi De Mohrenschildt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's the second wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. It's Didi De Mohrenschildt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She is the Sharples girl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. The Sharples girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did it come to your attention that his present wife was
either born in China or went at a very early age, an infant age&mdash;came to
China?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. I don't know anything about her except I know that she
is part Russian, French&mdash;something else, but you see, she never expounded her
views to me about her beliefs, but she did to lots of Americans, you see, and they
would ask me why? What does it mean? You know, for some reason or other&mdash;and
I would like this off the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>(At this point statement by the witness, Mr. Raigorodsky, to Counsel Jenner
off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is the reaction of the Russian community in Dallas to the
De Mohrenschildts, with particular reference to their political views?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Well, the Russian community here, it was, you say&mdash;"And
political views?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The views separately of George De Mohrenschildt, and then his
wife, Jean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Well, would you believe me if I tell you that after all this
time, I do not know the political views of George De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us about him, what kind of a person is he? He seems from
some of our information to be reckless, to make nonsense at times, he appears
to have traveled extensively in Europe, Mexico, Haiti, the Dominican Republic;
he is a man who has provoked or seems to seek to provoke others into argument
by making outlandish statements. We would like to know something from
you as a&mdash;if I may use the expression but in a sense of compliment&mdash;a member
of the "Old Guard," and you have had some contact with this man for 17 years
now&mdash;what is he or what makes him tick?</p>

<p>He had contact with the Oswalds, we haven't yet talked with him, and we are
seeking to get all the information we can about this man, his personality, his
habits, his business interests, his contacts with you&mdash;political views even if
they are stated in supposed jest, and the political views of his wife, Jeanne, who
is tolerant? Is he just a character?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's a question. You see, talking about, and believe me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
that's the only time&mdash;first of all, I've got George De Mohrenschildt to become
a member of the Petroleum Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is the Petroleum Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. It is the Petroleum Club, Dallas Petroleum Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you seek to do it for him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was a man of grace at the club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Very much so a man of grace, a man of breeding.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did he begin to move in a different social circle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. An entirely different social circle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was that a social circle of Russian emigre, a certain set of
Russian emigre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. No, no, that's the thing which both churches have against
them. He belonged to the church, but he never sent in a donation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He belonged to the church in the sense that when he felt like
coming, he came, but he never supported the church financially?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. No, that's right, from that point. Politically he never,
and I can say honestly, not one time did he ever discuss with me any political
questions or give me his views except one time when he went to take the trip&mdash;the
walking trip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From the border of the United States and the Mexican border
down to Panama?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us the incident that you are about to relate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Except one time, you see, except one time&mdash;he was elated
because he met Mikoyan in Mexico.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did he report this to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. You know&mdash;just trying to show what&mdash;he always brags
about things&mdash;he was bragging about many things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he given to overstatements?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Very much so, and he brags about the fact that he met
Mr. Mikoyan, and this is not for publication, and I asked him why didn't he
shoot this b&mdash;&mdash;d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did he say&mdash;when you said, "Why didn't you shoot him?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. He just smiled and smiled with that understanding smile,
you see, as if I were taking away from his achievement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he a man of extraordinary dress or attire?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Anything but ordinary in attire.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was not only provocative in his habits, but provocative in
his attire in the sense of nonconforming?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. He is&mdash;he is absolutely nonconformist&mdash;that's the best
definition I can give you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does he speak Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Oh, yes; he speaks Russian quite well with a by-the-Baltic
German accent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does his wife Jeanne speak Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does she have any peculiarity of accent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Well, I say her's would be Polish, but you know, it is
very hard to say. I don't think she was born in Russia, I think she was born
in France or somewhere, or maybe China, but George's was definitely, because
he was born in Russia. Now, to me George&mdash;now this is again my <span class="locked">idea&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We are trying to get a background on him and we want your idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. I don't believe that George is a Communist, because I don't
think that the Communists would stand for the behavior of George in the United
States. I mean, that is the only thing that I can give him credit for. To
them it is a religion. You see, communism is a religion to them and they lead,
as we should, I understand they lead the Spartan life, I mean, they are supposed
to, but George led anything but the Spartan life in this country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have some business relations with him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. I had some small stock deals with him, oil deals when he
would drill a well and I would buy a certain portion of the deal, maybe one-sixteenth
or something like that. He had one dry hole I can remember and one
well that came in very small and nothing to brag about and he tried to get me
to go with him in business with him in Haiti.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. To the banker&mdash;the banker&mdash;Commercial de Haiti. You
can read that and pick up anything you want here and tell me what you want
[referring to deponent's file]. He writes all the time&mdash;he was trying to get a
$100,000 corporation set up here to do business with Duvalier, the head of the
Haitian Government in the making of hemp and they were giving him concessions
and lots of acreage which you could pick up for drilling and everything
else, and he was trying to get people to come here and subscribe to stock but he
didn't do anything. I believe that I have reported that incident and then there
are lots of Russians here and some others told me about that trip of George's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Down through Mexico?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Down through Mexico, and I believe I called the FBI and
told them. I said, "I don't know whether it means anything or nothing."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who is Mr. John De Menil?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Mr. John De Menil is a very close friend of mine. He is
the financial head of Schlumberger Co. and when I wouldn't go with George in
the deal, he asked me to give him any suggestion as to who may be interested, so
I suggested John De Menil because the Schlumberger Co. is a worldwide organization
and they deal with every country in the world&mdash;you know what I am
trying to say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes; I do. I am familiar with the name Schlumberger.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. And that he might be interested in going in business in
Haiti, and at my suggestion he called him and went to see him and nothing came
out of it because John De Menil finally turned him down after the investigation.</p>

<p>Now, I am very sorry that in the past years I have had some correspondence
with George but I didn't keep it, but then when things began to pop up and his
name appeared in so many different things, I thought I better keep a file on him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Apparently this Haitian venture was in gestation or in the works
as far back as 1962, is that what you understand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes; you know, he was consultant to the Yugoslav Government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was a consultant to the Yugoslavian Government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. He was a consultant to the Yugoslavian Government. In
fact, he was sent to Yugoslavian Government with the blessing of our Government,
maybe&mdash;I don't know under what protocol that we were helping the
Yugoslavians, and he went over there but peculiarly, in order to receive the
appointment he had to have recommendations of some man known in the industry,
and he didn't come to me&mdash;I can say this&mdash;I don't brag, but if he came
to me that would have meant something to him because I was with the Government
on a couple or two or three times, but instead of that he goes to Jake
Hamon, a close friend of mine, and asked him for a recommendation on that
job. Jake said he would not give him a recommendation unless he consults me.
That surprised me that he wouldn't ask me right off the bat, but he went around
about way. What could I do? Of course I said, technically on the job he is
perfectly all right, I mean, he is a good engineer&mdash;good petroleum engineer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that's your opinion of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Oh, yes, without any question. You know, that field is
quite a field&mdash;that you have to be supplied with a knowledge of underground
structures and movement of the oil, and he had a good job, and as far as I
know he quit the job&mdash;he was not fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you acquainted with his reputation in this community for
truth and veracity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Well, I'll say there is no other way around this&mdash;I don't
think his reputation is that of a truthful person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. His reputation in that respect is poor or bad?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Bad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Bad, and his reputation in the community as a man of morals,
character, and integrity&mdash;is that bad or good?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Bad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And his reputation in the community as a man of capability in
the profession which he pursues?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For example&mdash;as a petroleum geologist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. No; petroleum engineer&mdash;good. His knowledge of languages
is good. In fact, he taught at the University of Texas. I believe he
taught French or Spanish after he went to school there, where my daughter
went, one of my daughters, and my son-in-law also went there at the same
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is his reputation in the community as being a loyal American?
If he has a reputation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. I don't think he has any reputation of that type. Now,
remember there are two&mdash;he is in a different social circle now, you see, than he
was before with his second wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. In fact, if I'm not mistaken how he got to the Oswalds
was through the Clarks. You see, the Clarks of Fort Worth were his friends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From a prior social circle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. No; he met them&mdash;I don't know where he met them, but they
were not in the so-called Dallas social circle that he was originally in with his
wife because of her being a Sharples.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know of any business interests of De Mohrenschildt in
Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. In Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; in the last 5 years, let's say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes; he told me that he was going to see Herman and
George Brown&mdash;they are brothers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What business are they in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Well, again, don't put this down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion between Messrs. Jenner and Davis and the witness, Mr. Raigorodsky,
off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now; I want this on the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. George has been friends with many, many influential
people in many cities.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. In all of them, I imagine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is he a namedropper&mdash;is he a man who seeks to be friends of
important people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. No&mdash;he was my friend, I was his friend&mdash;he was Jake
Hamon's friend and Jake Hamon was his friend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. How often did De Mohrenschildt see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Jake?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No; how often did George De Mohrenschildt see Herman and
George Brown?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. I don't know, but he has been going to Houston quite
often. In fact, he told me that everything is settled&mdash;he is going to deal with
them in that Haiti situation, and then Herman died.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know of any particular business that he had in Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What information do you have regarding his interests or business
in Houston&mdash;I take it that it came from his making statements to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's right, except in his dealing with John De Menil,
in which John De Menil sent me the copies of the letters&mdash;you see, there is a
copy from John De Menil.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where do you have information as to whether he was required
to or did make regular trips, a trip every 4 or 5 weeks, to Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. He&mdash;I can't answer that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He appears to have become acquainted with a gentleman in
Houston by the name of Andre Jitkoff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes; sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He is a professor at Rice Institute?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's right&mdash;he's head of the Russian church in Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He is the head of the Russian church in Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes; that's right&mdash;also his daughter is my&mdash;I'm a godfather
to Mr. Jitkoff's daughter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, give me in a thumbnail sketch, something about Mr. Jitkoff's
background.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Mr. Jitkoff&mdash;he is of the "Russian Old Guard," as you
call it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How old a man is he, by the way, your best guess?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. I would say around 60 now, no, maybe he is younger&mdash;let's
see, his daughter&mdash;he probably is closer&mdash;is 50 some odd years&mdash;55.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He is closer to 50 than to 60?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is he somewhere between 50 and 60?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's right. The first I knew of Jitkoff, he was a tennis
pro at the River Oaks Country Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where&mdash;Dallas or Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. In Houston; and he retired several years ago and he is
teaching Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was De Mohrenschildt an athletic man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Very much so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is he interested in tennis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes; very much so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What about Mrs. De Mohrenschildt? Is she an athletically
inclined person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Also interested in tennis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And does each of them have an interest in any other sport to
the extent of engaging in the sport itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. As far as I know&mdash;swimming.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Ice skating?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. I don't remember anything about that, but they always
played tennis, you know, they lived next door to me, you see, they played tennis
all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did either of them ever live in the Stoneleigh Hotel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. At the Maple Terrace. You see, it is owned by the same
people&mdash;the Stoneleigh, Maple, and now there's another Terrace&mdash;the Tower
Terrace.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are these buildings all in proximity one with the other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Oh, yes; and they are owned by the same people, by the
Leo Corrigan's son-in-law, Jordan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In addition to being an expansive person, is De Mohrenschildt a
generous man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes; I would say he is a generous man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is he the type of person who would seek, out of the goodness of
his heart, to help people like the Oswalds or persons in like circumstances?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. I would say he will do it because he wants to show what
a grand person he is. You see, that would be my quick judgment. It would
be different from the other Russians, you see, because they were appalled at
the fact that the baby didn't have milk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is, De Mohrenschildt might not have been sincere, while
the other members who were seeking to assist were genuine and sincere about
it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. De Mohrenschildt might be trying to put on a show, for example?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Exactly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was he a man given to extreme statements in public?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes. Even though in a joking way. Maybe, like, at a big
party&mdash;I'll never forget that, you see. It was for the first time I met him. It
was at the Brook Hollow Golf Club before it burned down, at a big party and
you know. I had some friends of mine, the Jake Hamons and the others, and
suddenly George, you know, he always managed to do it, he always said, "There's
a spy in the crowd." You know, he would say, "There's a spy in the crowd,"
just for the fun of it or whatever it is. So, we all started to say, "There's a
spy in the crowd," and somebody asked me, "Are you the spy?" And I said,
"Maybe," but that's the way he always did&mdash;just create some kind of maybe
innocent unrest, but we didn't know how much truth there was to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And would you give us the reason for that view?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Because he's liable to do anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Liable to do anything because he is eccentric. He has no control
over himself, really?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's what it is&mdash;because of his character.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you have the impression that De Mohrenschildt is the
type of person that might seek to induce others to do something he might
hesitate to do himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. No; I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is your opinion as to the legitimacy of the business in
which he is engaged in Haiti?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Well, from the point of view of the U.S. Government, it
is a legitimate business to do business up until now with Haiti. I think the
other day&mdash;it was the first time that we granted them a loan or aid, but we
wouldn't deal with Duvalier, but George moved there&mdash;he is there, and moved
his furniture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's so&mdash;in the spring of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have had correspondence with him since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have given me a file and it is entitled "George De Mohrenschildt".
I have been browsing through it. It seems to relate almost exclusively
to the Haitian venture, and I don't see anything else in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Here is a letter of June 30 that must have been left here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is this June 30, 1963, or 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. It must be 1963&mdash;yes, it is 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If this was June of 1963, this was before the events of November
22&mdash;I gather from your first sentence of this letter that he had been in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. After this&mdash;that's right; I see it is 1963, after this fiasco
here, then he came back to Dallas&mdash;which I was called on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, the "fiasco here in Dallas" I take it from your testimony,
was the suit brought by De Mohrenschildt against his wife Didi, and that suit
was brought in Philadelphia and it had to do with the disposition of a corpus
residue of a trust established for George's son.</p>

<p>As I recall, friends of the Sharples family appealed to you, or maybe sued
directly, to see what you could do to help out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. No; friends of her family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Friends of her family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. In fact, Mrs. Crespi, appealed to me to see what I can do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who is Mrs. Crespi?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Mrs. Pio Crespi is a very well known person here. Her
husband is retired; he has a company called Crespi &amp; Co.&mdash;a cotton exchange
brokerage. She is a close friend of the Sharples family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Crespi?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What do you understand Mr. De Mohrenschildt is doing over
in Haiti?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Well, he told me that he wants to get in on the ground
floor and he has a connection with the top banker in the country who is the
Duvalier banker, and that way he will be able to pickup some "juicy plums"
in Haiti. That's exactly what he told me. That's why he wanted to organize
the corporation here, you see, to go to Haiti and build plants and help them to
develop the industry and reap the profits. You see, it so happened that I believe
it is very hard to be a specialist in one line, and almost impossible in two, and
my specialty is oil and all my business is in oil. If he came with an oil deal,
I might be interested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you say in describing this man, that he has a sort of
an adolescence personality, a fellow who has really never grown up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. It isn't a sort of&mdash;he is adolescent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He is adolescent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. George will never grow old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But will he grow up; is he lacking in maturity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. He always did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And things that amuse him are the sort of things that amused
us, let's say, when we were adolescent&mdash;in our teens?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. When we were 16&mdash;that's right&mdash;any kind of pranks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He is a prankster?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Oh, yes, sir. And he does it so engagingly. I mean, his
laugh is a genuine laugh and if you ever heard his laugh&mdash;he enjoys it. You
see, it is a genuine laugh and of course that is very, very effective, you know,
as far as other people are concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Would you say he is very <span class="locked">distinct&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. There is no word for that&mdash;very engaging, I suppose would
be the nearest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think you mentioned, but I failed to pursue it, I think De
Mohrenschildt sought to borrow money from you, did he, in 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Occasionally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In connection with the Haitian venture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He did not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. No; he sought to have me to participate in the deal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you did or didn't?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that was to be what kind of a deal?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Well, it is a corporation&mdash;here is a chart of what he was
planning to do.</p>

<p>(Handed instrument to Counsel Jenner.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you have exhibited to me a chart that you have taken from
your file. There is handwriting on the chart&mdash;is that George De Mohrenschildt's
handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he send that chart to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes; here's the envelope.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And have you attached to the chart the envelope in which the
chart was transmitted to you, and it is postmarked September 12, 1962, at
Dallas, Tex., and is this an outline?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Of what he plans to do there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of what he planned to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. You see, "Port-au-Prince, August 27, 1962." He shows he
will have group insurance, cheap housing development, banking, cotton gin, electric
powerplant, import franchise, spinning mill, weaving plant for cotton mill,
and he puts down here "credits available for these industries."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have any information that he is surveying the physical
characteristics of the surface? Of the entire Haitian area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Well, that's what my understanding was, that that is how
he got in so close to them&mdash;because it was one of his consulting jobs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For the Haitian Government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. For the Haitian Government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is he still engaged on that; do you know, or are you informed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. I don't know&mdash;I am not informed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it your impression that his Haitian proposal was legitimate,
that is, a legitimate speculation or otherwise. What I am getting at, in other
words, that it was not anything of an ulterior character?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Well, here's some more of the same thing, which I think
might be helpful. Here's what information which they send to John De Menil.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which he was sending to John De Menil?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. It's a copy for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is to John De Menil?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would I have your permission to have these documents in your
file duplicated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Oh, sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I'll tell you what would be helpful to me&mdash;if you would have your
secretary restore the file, because you have been generously pulling documents
out of it, and if she will restore it to the order in which it was originally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then I will be able to go through it with you.</p>

<p>(At this point the witness, Mr. Raigorodsky, called his secretary, Mrs. Louise
Meek, into the deposing office, giving her the instructions to comply with Counsel
Jenner's request, and after leaving the deposing office and returning thereto
shortly with the file in the order as requested, Mrs. Meek then departed the
deposing room and the deposition continued as follows:)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. This shows the Haitian holding company. It shows what
they are trying to do. There is correspondence with the bank and everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There were two files there, as I recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. You can have them both&mdash;the other one is on the well
operation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, I understand. You were participating with him in some
drilling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And they were either dry holes or they didn't amount to anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. One dry hole and one other. I want to ask you something?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Have you ever talked to Mr. H. Gordon Calder. Mr. H.
Gordon Calder is an oil man in Shreveport, La. He is a close friend of mine;
in fact, he probably was the first friend I had in this country. We went to the
University of Texas together. That's over 40 years ago. His last job before
he quit, he was the head of the Southern Production Co., quite a large organization,
and George has been working on several oil deals with Gordon Calder,
and Gordon Calder has been more in contact with George than I have in the
last several years. I see that Gordon Calder was in this well too; my office
has the telephone number and address of Mr. Calder, in fact, if necessary, I
can call him and he will come over here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know whether Professor Jitkoff is acquainted with De
Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Oh, I'm sure he is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are acquainted with Basil Zavoico?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Basil&mdash;he is a Russian. His father was a general in the
Russian Army. He has a brother. Basil Zavoico has been&mdash;his primary business
has been what I would say is a bank and insurance consultant on oil
matters. He has been with Prudential Insurance Co.; he has been with Chase
National Bank. He was their consultant; and he has been in a business of his
own mostly connected with oil financing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he at one time reside in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. No; he resided in Houston.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know whether he would be acquainted then with George
De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Oh, yes; I'm sure that they had some oil dealings. Now,
both Gordon Calder and Zavoico probably had more dealings with George than
I had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he lives in Green Farms, Conn.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And his place is known as "Cronomere"? Is there anything that
occurs to you that might be helpful to the Commission, first, in its investigation
of the assassination of President Kennedy; and secondly, in regards to the
character and integrity of, background and interests of George De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Well, the only thing I can say that I was told&mdash;it is a
hearsay&mdash;that after meeting Marina Oswald&mdash;the way Russians met, there was
a party somewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There was what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. A party&mdash;a social gathering.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Somewhere&mdash;I don't remember where.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Here in this country?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Here in Dallas, and at that party, there were several Russians,
and they claimed that in walks George De Mohrenschildt with Marina
Oswald and her husband. That's the only thing that out of everything that
they told me that stuck in my mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall anybody who was reported to have been at this
party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Well, I'll say that Mr. Bouhe and Anna Meller.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. M-e-l-l-e-r [spelling]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes; I'm not quite sure&mdash;there were quite a few other
Russians, but it was George who brought the Oswalds into the party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We have had some off the record discussions all in the presence
of Miss Oliver and Mr. Davis. Is there anything that occurred during our
off-the-record discussions that is pertinent, which I have failed to bring out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. No; if it was pertinent I would not have taken it off of
the record.</p>

<p>Now, may I say something myself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Certainly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Would you care to know what my opinion of the assassination
is, or is that just an opinion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right; let's have it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. I still believe it is a conspiracy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, on what do you base that opinion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Well, I have read&mdash;I'm quite sure everything that you
have read, and you read probably more than I did because you have these
interrogations.</p>

<p>There are just so many things that are unbelievable, that a person like Oswald,
would be allowed to do the things in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We are interested in that sort of an opinion. What is the basis
of your opinion in that respect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Well, I have studied communism and I have watched them
operating, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>(Discussion between Counsel Jenner and the witness, Raigorodsky, off the
record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I want that on the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Well&mdash;the fact that they gave you all of the record, they
gave you all of the records on Oswald, that he was running around in Russia,
marrying a Russian woman, that she was allowed to go out of Russia&mdash;I know
several cases where they wouldn't allow a person whom Americans marry to
come for several years. Here, everything was (snapping his fingers) so&mdash;just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
like that. It just reads too much like a fairy tale. I mean, as much as they
claim they don't trust him, they surely didn't show it by the action in granting
him different things which he received in Russia and in this country.</p>

<p>Now, Marina, I don't know anything about her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is your supposition and rationalization on your part?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now. I have your <span class="locked">file&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Now you take anything you want out of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Let's do it this way&mdash;I have your file which you have
kept marked "Re: George De Mohrenschildt."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will just identify these documents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. You don't need to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I need it for my record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Oh, all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am not questioning you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Well, I'm not questioning you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The bottom portion of this sheet consists of a duplicate telegram,
and the upper portion consists of some French language or what might be
clippings from a French newspaper. It is marked with a circle No. 1 [document
is in evidence as De Mohrenschildt Exhibit No. 1].</p>

<p>What are they and how did you get those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. He sent them to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. De Mohrenschildt sent that to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Oh yes; it is about a recent voyage to the United States
of Mr. Clemard Joseph Charles. You see, he was trying to prove to me that
Mr. Charles persona grata, both in Haiti and in the United States and was a
big shot and here he was sending me some information about him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next document is what purports to be a carbon copy of a
letter dated July 27, 1962, addressed to Mr. Jean de Menil of Houston, Tex. It
is marked with a circle No. 2 [document is in evidence as De Mohrenschildt Exhibit
No. 5]. It has a typewritten signatures on the second page, "G. De Mohrenschildt."
I see in the upper right hand corner, written in longhand "copy for
Mr. Raigorodsky."</p>

<p>In whose handwriting is that notation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. His.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is in George De Mohrenschildt's handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he send that carbon copy of a letter to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's right, and this was the&mdash;outlining a project in Haiti
and the West Indies.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was there an outline enclosed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is that the next sheet which is entitled:
"Haitian Holding Co.," dated August 1, 1962, and is on the letterhead of
George De Mohrenschildt? Petroleum geologist and engineer, Republic National
Bank Building, Dallas, Tex. [De Mohrenschildt Exhibit No. 6.]</p>

<p>That was enclosed with the letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes, this is the letter and then this is the outline, and
besides that, you see, here is the outline of what he planned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The outline to which he refers is set forth in the two-page carbon
copy of a letter I have heretofore identified?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And there's also enclosed with it what appears to be the mimeographed
one piece sheet I have described, dated August 1, 1962, that has the
mimeographed signature at the bottom, "G. De Mohrenschildt." Is that his
signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. These documents were transmitted to you. Did you save the
envelope?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is the envelope clipped to the letter in the file? [De Mohrenschildt
Exhibit No. 3.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes, this looks like it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Mr. De Mohrenschildt addressed it to you, is that in his
handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that's August 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then, next is a letter on a letterhead of&mdash;would you read that
for me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes, yes; it is the Banque Commerciale D'Haiti.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it is dated July 31, 1962. It is addressed to Mr. De Mohrenschildt,
a typewritten signature of "Clemard Joseph Charles." This seems to
be a duplicated letter. [De Mohrenschildt Exhibit No. 2.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. It's a photostat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Mr. De Mohrenschildt send that to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On or about July 31, 1962, or shortly thereafter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next document consists of&mdash;it looks like an organization
chart? [De Mohrenschildt Exhibit No. 10.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. It isn't quite an organization chart, it is the chart of the
different projects that he planned to have in Haiti.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And here again there is some longhand writing in ink.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that De Mohrenschildt's writing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And his signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he also has written on there "Dallas, September 11, 1962."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you retain the envelope [De Mohrenschildt Exhibit No. 8],
in which that document, marked with a circled No. 5, was transmitted to you, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is it the next document which in turn is clipped to what I
called an organizational chart? [De Mohrenschildt Exhibit No. 10.] And just
a diagram?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did anything else accompany that diagram?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. No, I'm quite sure nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Next is a photostatic copy of a telegram. [De Mohrenschildt
Exhibit No. 7]. It appears addressed to Lt.&mdash;is that what that is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. No, no; that's De Mohrenschildt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It should have been "De" Mohrenschildt and it is "Lt. Mohrenschildt,
6628 Dickens, Dallas."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It has a signature by "Tardieu". How did you come by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. He sent it to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next document [De Mohrenschildt Exhibit No. 16], appears to
be a copy of a letter on August 7, 1963, addressed to "Mr. Jean de Menil," with a
typewritten signature "George De Mohrenschildt." On the face of that document
appears more handwriting&mdash;do you recognize the handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whose is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. It's signed by George.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It's George De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the "Dear Paul," in the footnote at the bottom of that
letter is you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the memorandum is for you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that includes his handwriting on a notation in the upper
right hand corner, "Copy for Mr. Paul Raigorodsky", correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next appears to be the original of a letter on blue stationery,
the letterhead of which is "3363 San Felipe Road, Houston, Tex." It has a
typewritten signature, "John de Menil" and then apparently is signed by a
secretary, and it is addressed to you, is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes; and he investigated it later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he is making a report to you and also then decided he is
not interested?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. But read this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>"Dear Paul:</p>

<p>George De Mohrenschildt is a nice man, but I do not think his project is very
well cooked. It is slightly visionary and not specific at all. This, of course,
is my own personal reaction which I am giving you for your confidential information.
It was also the reaction of my friend on Wall Street to whom I talked
in the hope that perhaps he could get something out of the idea of George De

<p>The next document is a carbon copy of a letter dated August 8, 1962, with
the typewritten signature of John de Menil. [Raigorodsky Exhibit No. 9.] It
is addressed to Mr. George De Mohrenschildt in Dallas. You received that, did
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it was transmitted to you by Mr. de Menil's secretary; is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next is also a carbon copy&mdash;this is a letter to Mr. George
De Mohrenschildt from Mr. John de Menil and it is dated August 27, 1962, with
a copy to Paul Raigorodsky. [Raigorodsky Exhibit No. 10-B.]</p>

<p>From whom did you receive that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. From Mr. de Menil.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And then we have an envelope and a card enclosed. The envelope
[Raigorodsky Exhibit No. 10], is postmarked in New York May 11, 1963. The envelope
is addressed to Mr. Paul M. Raigorodsky, First National Building, Dallas,
Tex.</p>

<p>Do you recognize the handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the bottom of the envelope and the enclosed card [Raigorodsky
Exhibit No. 10-A]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is that [Raigorodsky Exhibit No. 10-A] in Mr. De Mohrenschildt's
handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was it a card enclosed in that envelope?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next is an original of a letter addressed to Raigorodsky,
dated June 6, 1963, signed, "Jeanne and George de M." [Raigorodsky Exhibit
No. 11.]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
Is that George De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is everything that is in handwriting on the face of that letter
in his handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you received that in due course?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. This was written from Port-au-Prince.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was written on the stationery of a hotel, Hotel Sans Souci.
Port-au-Prince, Haiti. [Raigorodsky Exhibit No. 11-A.]</p>

<p>The next document is an original letter from the De Mohrenschildts, it is a
typewritten letter and is signed, "George and Jeanne" over the typewritten
signature "Jeanne and George De Mohrenschildt," and is addressed to "Dear
Paul." Up here in the right hand corner is "Port-au-Prince, September 12, 1963,
c/o American Embassy." [De Mohrenschildt Exhibit No. 9.]</p>

<p>That is a letter to you, is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You received it in due course?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There is attached to the letter an envelope addressed to you, it
looks like that is his handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes, that George's handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is that the envelope in which the letter of September 12,
1963, was enclosed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes, I'm sure it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, Mr. Raigorodsky has handed me an envelope postmarked
in New York, May 18, 1963, to which he has made reference in his testimony.
It is addressed to Mr. Paul M. Raigorodsky, and it looks like fifth floor, First
National Bank Building, Dallas, Tex., and it has a stamp on it, "May 20, 1963."
That is a rubber stamp imprinted, accompanying this envelope, and there is
handed to me his longhand note on "Racquet &amp; Tennis Club" imprinted card,
dated in longhand, "May 18, 1963." [Raigorodsky Exhibits Nos. 14 and 14-A,
respectively.]</p>

<p>It begins, "Dear Paul," and is signed by "Geo. De M."</p>

<p>Mr. Raigorodsky, are this envelope and card in Mr. De Mohrenschildt's handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes, they are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was the card enclosed in the envelope here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes, and here is another letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Raigorodsky has handed me another letter written on both
sides, entirely on both sides in longhand, dated June 30, at Miami, and signed
"Jeanne and George De M.". [De Mohrenschildt Exhibit No. 4.]</p>

<p>Do you recognize the handwriting on each side of that letter, Mr. Raigorodsky?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whose is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. De Mohrenschildt's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you receive it in due course subsequent to June 30&mdash;of
what year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. 1963. This is very interesting&mdash;this is a map of Haiti. You
see where he sent me&mdash;he said "Our Shada Concession."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Raigorodsky, has opened up a Texaco map of Haiti, [De Mohrenschildt
Exhibit No. 11] Republica Dominicana on the face of the map&mdash;there
is handwriting&mdash;do you recognize that handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes; that's George De Mohrenschildt's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you receive that from him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. I can't answer that&mdash;it probably is mentioned in one of
the letters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. One of the letters I have identified?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But all of that is his handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes; and you see, he has written in here "Oil possibilities
Mellon Concession" and "Our Shada Concession."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is "Shada"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. That's where he claims he had the concessions for the hemp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For hemp or sisal there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Yes; sisal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. These things will all show up on any photostat immediately of
this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I state for the record, Mr. Raigorodsky, has authorized
us to make a copy of papers I have identified and identified them in the record,
so one thing is helpful&mdash;I don't have to go to the trouble of preparing a receipt
because you have it in the record, and secondly, in the event&mdash;if we seek to
question Mr. De Mohrenschildt I will have these documents identified as to their
authenticity by way of this questioning of you.</p>

<p>Thank you very much, sir, you have been extremely patient and I would like
the record to show that Mr. Raigorodsky appeared voluntarily, also he has a
very bad cold which has been quite obvious and came to the U.S. attorney's office
about 10:30 a.m. and then we repaired to here, his office, and it is now 2:15
in the afternoon and he has been under questioning during that whole period
of time. I appreciate this personally and I know the Commission will. I offer
in evidence the foregoing documents as Raigorodsky Exhibits Nos. 9, 10, 10-A,
10-B, 11, 11-A, 14, and 14A.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Raigorodsky</span>. I hope to help you in some way, but I'm just as lost at this
moment as I was then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, you have been very helpful throughout this.</p>

<p>Mr. Raigorodsky, Miss Oliver, the reporter, will transcribe this deposition
possibly during the course of the week, if not, it will be ready next week, and
you have the right to read it and make some corrections, suggestions or additions,
and to sign it. That is a privilege that is accorded you, if you wish to

Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to
give here will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help
you God?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. My name is Wesley J. Liebeler. I am a member of the legal
staff of the President's Commission investigating the assassination of President
Kennedy. Staff members have been authorized to take the testimony of witnesses
by the Commission pursuant to authority granted to the Commission by
Executive Order 11130 dated November 29, 1963, and Joint Resolution of Congress
No. 137.</p>

<p>I believe Mr. Rankin sent you a letter last week?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; and I read it and have your name, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He sent with that letter copies of the Executive order and the

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Under the rules of the Commission each witness is entitled to
3 days' notice before he has to testify and I suppose technically since you did
not get the letter until Monday you do not have to testify today or you can
waive that notice, and I presume you are willing to go ahead with the questioning
at this time; is that correct?</p>

Dallas in December 1962, as the events at that party related to or involved Lee
Harvey Oswald. We also want to question you about meetings and/or parties
that you went to at other places in Dallas during the period shortly after
December 28, 1962. Before we get into that, would you state your full name for
the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you leave Stalingrad?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Let me see, in 1943, in time war; Germans come and taken over
Stalingrad and pick me up and send to Germany.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When the German troops reached Stalingrad they picked you
up and other Russian people?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yeah; lots of Russians and they send us to Germany in camp,
in concentration camp, labor camp, I guess, more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long were you in Germany?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I been there until I come to America, 1946.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How did it come about that you came to the United States;
what were the circumstances of your coming here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, I met my husband was town of Wiesbaden being liberated
by Americans and that's the first time we ever saw American people and then
they taken us out and tell us to wait until they able to send us to Russia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
At this time we been working for Americans, soldiers, something in kitchen
or different something, just for food until we be able to go back to Russia and
I met my husband and when I met him, well, I lost all contact with home and
been told there's nobody at home, no place to go and my husband tell me that
I can marry American man and I said, "No, I cannot marry American man because
Russia will not permit me to marry" and we did have lots of difficulty
to get marry and my husband went to Paris, France, to have permission that
they let us marry but they not let him see nobody, just asking where I am. I
have to hide at this time because Russia picking up and sending all back to
Russia, and my husband find me room in Germany where I have to stay until
we get married. Well, they&mdash;Russians don't give me permission for me to get
marry and later on I have to go up and became as a displaced person and in
1945, there, U.S. Government said could marry to displaced person and I marry
my husband in May 1945. Yeah, I guess 1945 or 1946&mdash;let me see, yeah, in 1945
because&mdash;or 1946. I guess. I'm sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were both in Germany at the time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; my husband and I used to travel when war still going on,
you know, they move and I move with him; that will be something come. We
go to Frankfurt; I went with him to Frankfurt. If he have to move I go with
him. Three Russian girls, us, together, and I did in 1946. I guess. I marry. I
forget now when, I am very sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That's all right; that's not important.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. War ended in 1945 and year later I married; that's in 1946, I'm
sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And then you came to the United States with your husband,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; well, we stay year in Germany after we marry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Then when he left Germany you came back to the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; I go with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you an American citizen now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever meet Lee Oswald or Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; I met them at this party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us about that in your own words; just tell us
how you came to the party and how you met Oswald and to the best of your
recollection just how it happened.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, I wrote short stories for magazine and Mrs. Harris, Zena
Harris, Ed Harris from Georgetown read that story and find my address and
found me Russian. Until this time I never been have any&mdash;nobody there from
Russian and I don't have not nobody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You had no contact with Russian speaking people?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; except some friend in New York what we used to live in Germany
together and we write each other Mrs. Harris called me on phone and
said that&mdash;"I know you are Russian and I like to talk to you." I said, "Well,
I am glad to know somebody Russian, just about forget how to talk to Russian."
She said she like to come over and see me. I tell her she welcome to it. They
did come visit us and she told me that they always get together in Dallas, lots
of Russian girls and Russian men have a party and she like for me to come
to this party. I said, "Well, I like to know, you know, more people Russian"
because I never have contact with nobody. Well, she calling on phone from
my house to Mr. Ford, Declan Ford and talk to his wife and tell her, said,
"I found one Russian" and said "I like for her to coming to this party." They
already planned this party. She asked her time when it's going to be. She
said on Friday&mdash;Friday, I kind of think 29 before New Year and she said she
welcome to it and said we going to have one Russian girl what just come back
from Russia. She said she just coming with man in United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mrs. Ford told you this, is that right?</p>

Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Just glad to meet somebody. Well, we promised that we will come
and Friday we go to this party and Mr. and Mrs. Harris and we went to
Mr. Ford house. When we coming there, there's lots of people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How many people were there, approximately, would you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Between 25, 30 people; I cannot tell exactly but it's lots of people
been there, and, surely, you know, you kind of like to know what's going on in
Russia. First things I like to know this girl and this man. Well, they introduced
everybody and then they tell that this Marina, she's come back from
Russia. Well, I started talk to her and asking how she like it here. She
said she liked very well. I said, "Did you have any difficulty to come to
America?" She said, "No, she don't have any at all." Very much surprise
me because I not been able to do much with my home. I not be able to send
them packages or&mdash;I said, "Oh, that's very good; I guess now it's change and
get better," I said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have relatives in Russia now that you know of?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; I have a niece what I been&mdash;she write my mother passed away
and I lost my brothers and sisters in war and then mother, when Germans take
me from home, my mother and two children, my sisters, stay and I together and
then they take me away. My mother and these two children stay. Then this
child, one got killed; still war going on and one niece, my sister's girl and
that's one is on the road out to my mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was she living in Stalingrad?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; at this time, no; they moved. At this time she lived in
Tchewchankowskiy, Rudnek. That's pretty close <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Kharkov?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. That's lots salt mines there and that's close Kharkov. That's not
too far from Kharkov.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I interrupted your story about your conversation with Marina.
Would you go on with that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes. After she told that she don't have any difficulty to come here,
you know, I, well, everybody interested. I told her, I said, "I am glad; I guess
get better because if they let you so easy to get out Russia then that's get little
bit better now and I guess they better friends." I said, "Maybe later on"&mdash;I
let be get contact now with niece. I been trying call her on telephone. I
never can get her on phone. I said, "Maybe I can calling her and talk to her
now" and I never planned to go back but, you know, just for somebody there
you want to get contact with and then another things I found out that her
husband is&mdash;she introduced me to her husband like she done everybody and he
speak just perfect Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he speak to you in Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; just perfect; really surprised me and I said "How come you
speak so good Russian. How long you been in Russia?" He said well, he don't
been there too long. He said he been just 3 year. I said "You just been
<span class="locked">three&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Excuse me, how long?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Three year. I said "You speak good Russian." I asked him, I said
"Do you like" no; I asked "How you like Russia?" He said "Oh, it's all right."
But he don't have much to say, you know, but he always staying close to Marina
and every time you asking something he seems to be one to answer it. If
someone say where you from, he tell you. Maybe he just plain wanted let you
know he speak Russian or something. I don't know reason but seems to me
that he all time interfere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you would ask Marina a question Oswald himself would
want to tell you the answer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes, always; he be very close.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ask him if he had gone to school anywhere to learn
Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; I don't but I give him credit for speak so well Russian. I
said "I been here so long and still don't speak very well English"; I said "You
speak fast Russian." He said in Russia he learn to speak Russian. He just
came back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You thought he spoke Russian better than you would expect
a person to be able to speak Russian after only living there only 3 years?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; I really did. I don't know, maybe Russian easy. I know
American is very difficult language but I been taught here. Really, it's just
too good speaking Russian for be such a short time, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you anything about how he learned to speak Russian
or did he just say it was from being in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; I never asked. Only things, I give him credit he speak so well
Russian and I don't ask and then I want to introduce him to my husband,
you know. He is an American and my husband did not remember him very
well how he look and my husband, I guess, have few drinks and he is man don't
talk much. This Oswald don't say much and you introduce and that's as far
as go but he always constantly staying very close to his wife, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us the rest of your conversation with Marina or with
Oswald as best you can recall it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, after she told that she don't have any difficulty and we decided
that everything is getting better and we started asking her about Russian
songs and they start to sing in Russian songs, and asking her sing, if she know
any latest Russian song, and she start sing and we sing with her together and
then I notice that's all been say as much conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ask her where she lived when she was in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; I ask her where she come from. She said she come from
Minsk but said later she coming from Moscow. She been in Moscow with her
husband. He has a paper fix and she said as soon as he got his paper fix to
go to America, said she did not have difficulty. He told them he ready to go
and he going to take her with him and said she got paper and they left. Don't
take too long; said he have to wait for little while. I believe she said a year,
have to wait before he got his paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Before he got his paper from the Americans or from the
Russians; did she say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; from Americans to go back to America; so he decided to go
back to America.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she tell you how long they stayed in Moscow?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. She stayed 1 year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. She said they were in Moscow 1 year?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; see, from Minsk he have to go in Moscow to American Embassy
to talking he wanted to go back and they staying year in Moscow before he
got this paper and as soon as he got paper, he let Russian Embassy know he
got paper, they ready to leave and said they give her paper and they left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The Russians gave her the papers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina mention she had lived in Leningrad at one time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; not that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know or did she tell you she had relatives in Kharkov?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you learn what kind of job Oswald had while he was in
Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, not exactly; all I know she said he working on factory, some
factory and we don't get any details.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did they tell you where this factory was located?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Located what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where was the factory that Oswald worked in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. In Minsk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald work while they stayed in Moscow a year? Do
you know about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; I cannot help in this. I do not know. I know that they coming
and stay in Moscow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you sure that she told you they stayed in Moscow for a
whole year or did they just go to Moscow to see about the papers and then come
back to Minsk and wait in Minsk for the year to go by?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, really, when Mrs. Ford call us, she on telephone told us that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
she come from Moscow, you know. That is girl, Russian girl, she says she come
back from Moscow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. From Moscow?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yeah, and then later on Marina said that she, you know&mdash;let me see
how she say&mdash;that she come from Moscow. She fly&mdash;not fly&mdash;I do not know
how they come but she say from Moscow she come to America but she been in
Moscow 1 year. Said that's year or little better but she been in Moscow with
him; that's what she tell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. For a year?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But they did not tell you what they were doing there for a job?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; well, she tell he have to wait on paper this long and that's as
far as I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, did Marina know how to speak English as far as you
could tell?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; she don't understand word. She speak Russian but she don't
understand English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald or Marina tell you what kind of an apartment they
had to live in when they lived in Minsk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did they tell you where they lived when they were in Moscow?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you remember anything else that they may have told you
about the time that they were in Russia together?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, I don't think anything else. I can recall main things. I
never been concerned about where they lived or what they been doing. All I
wanted to know how easy she get out, you know; how come she so easy to go
when such a difficulty to have anything to do. That's why my impression been
that everything is get better, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did they tell you how much money Oswald was paid at his job?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Where, there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No, uh-uh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did they tell you why Oswald went to Russia in the first place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; but I read in the paper and then, you know, before he went,
I remember in Fort Worth paper, I read it about boy went to Russia that he said
that's government he preferred and that's place he want to go to live and&mdash;but
that's as far as&mdash;then Mrs. Harris is one that told me she know about him,
that he went to Russia and want to stay there and then he change his mind and
want to come back to America.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You knew that about Oswald when you met him at Ford's
party, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes&mdash;no, no; I don't know it because we suppose to know it and
Zena&mdash;that's Mrs. Harris&mdash;don't know either who they are but when we go
Mrs. Harris found out who is here and then she told me. That's in conversation,
you know, he went to Russia and don't like it and he come back but marry
this Russian girl and brought her with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So, you learned that at the Ford party because Mrs. Harris told
you that, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After the Oswalds left the party was there any discussion about
Oswald amongst the people there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, not that moment when they start leaving, well, we go to
Marina and I personally ask why they are leaving so early&mdash;I don't recall the
time&mdash;she said well, they coming with some couples, they don't have any car, they
came with somebody and said they ready to go and "We better go; we have baby
at home and we better go back." Well, we tell them "Bye" and that's as far
as went but after they left at this time there has been no discussion whatsoever,
you know, just they gone and everything is forgot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did there come a time later after the Ford party that there

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us to the best of your recollection what was
said at this party or get-together?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, when we got together, George Bouhe, one I told him, well,
when things we started discuss it and we just wonder how come America take
him back; said he choose this Russia, why they brought him back. Why don't
they just let him alone over there, and said "You don't know Russia as we do.
They have such funny tricks; never can tell what they can," but in the same
time thinking if he choosing go to Russia and said "That's my country", why
America want to bring him back, what for? We wonder why they take him
back. Well, there's George Bouhe said "Oh, he gives so much trouble" and
he start telling first things he cannot get job, said he kind of smart-aleck, he
calling him. Said every place he go looking for the job, when they ask him
where he last time work and he said Minsk, Russia, said "Well, who in heaven
going to give job?" He don't explain. He seems to be proud he working in
Russia and said nobody give him job and they been have very much difficulty
to making living and said they so sorry for this girl. Said he brought her here
and she don't know any language. Said she such have difficulty. They don't
wonder she have wrong impression about America. Said we been trying help
them. Said sometimes she call them and said she don't have nothing to eat
for her kid if they cannot help. Said we go and get her and said Mrs. Ford
keep her; Mrs. Meller keep her; Mrs. Ray keep her, not me, Ray, that's other
Ray. Said we try to help and then George tell me he decided help him try
find job maybe he can make living.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. George Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; George Bouhe, he said he go talk to somebody and they give
him job. Said you know how long he stay. Said he staying 3 days and quit
and I said "Well, I guess he expect since he been in Russia when he come back
in America that they going to put red carpet for him and take him." Said
well, tell us about America what is wrong, there in Russia they don't accept
him and when he come back home they don't need him either here, don't put red
carpet and he just disappoint and kind of, you know, just disgusted with everything
and he said "Well, I don't know but I give up with them; I am through,
we just cannot&mdash;he don't going to find job. He don't going to keep job." He
thinking he can have some kind of special job; said "I am just through with
him."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This is what Bouhe said?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; he said "as much as her, we want to help her because she
is strange in country and we don't want her be mistreated but said him, we
cannot help him any more" and that's as much as being said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What else was said at this time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, I don't know; I cannot recall right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there any discussion on the question of whether or not
Oswald might have been an agent of the Russian government?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, as an agent we not&mdash;but we did discuss. Said Russia, you
know, so funny; said never can tell they may send him with some kind of purpose
here in America but it isn't saying exactly as an agent but we did discuss
it that he may, you know, just send it by Russia because so easy way to coming
to America.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us now as best as you can recall just what was said about
this question of Oswald possibly being sent back by the Russians? What did
you say and what did Bouhe say; just tell us as best you can recall the substance
of that conversation.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I mostly talk to George Bouhe because he seems to be man what
try to bring this Russians together just have fun, not any purpose but said
kind of once in a year if we get together that's kind of help we don't forget
to speak Russian. I don't know, I guess I am one who told him, I said "George",
I said, "You know how Russia is funny", I said, "You know I just afraid maybe
they just send him with some kind of, you know, just send him here knowing
Russian." I go in college in Russia and if you live there and study you know
what really going on. They going to do such a trick that you surprise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where did you go to college in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. In Leningrad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In Leningrad?</p>

That's only on practice but I was work after I finish in Irkutsk, Siberia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. This was a Leningrad college?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No, no; that's Stalingrad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I mean college.</p>

Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; Leningrad&mdash;street Maxim Gorky Street. That's on Maxim
Gorky Street; that's college.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When were you there in Leningrad studying, what year, what
years?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. You mean when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. See, what happen I study and then I have a permission, not permission.
I have to go and work in Siberia, Irkutsk and before I go this far&mdash;that
is very far from my home, I have 2-months vacation and I went home.
From first I go to Irkutsk; then from there I coming home in summertime, in
June. My brother supposed to come home from flying school to get married
and I have 2 months after finish college. You have 2-months vacation; government
paying you go back home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. To Stalingrad?</p>

started, I wrote letter to this government place where you have to write that
you like to stay at home not to go back since war started that I like to staying
at home with my mother, not to go back in Siberia, and that's where I stay.
That's how come.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were there when the Germans arrived in Stalingrad?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; when Germans come there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So, you would have been studying at college in Leningrad from
about 1937, is that right, to 1941?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. In 1941 when I coming home and just about 4 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So, it would have been about 1937 or 1938 that you started
at the university in Leningrad?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, wait minute, 1938, 1939, 1940, 1941; see, 3½ year and they
constantly, every second year they send you some place, you know, practice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So, the time you were in Siberia was part of a practice program
in connection with your college?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; at this time that's my job. That's where I have to go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you actually go from Leningrad to Siberia to start work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; I went; I been once before on practice job then I come back
and then they assign me to Siberia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And, you actually went to Siberia before you came to Stalingrad?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long did you stay in Siberia before you came back to
Leningrad?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. This time I did not stay long. I had this plant they have on
ground.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Salt processing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; I have 2-months vacation and I told them that I did like to
go back home. You know they let you do these things; you have to admit it
and then go back and have us vacation and that's how come I coming home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So, you were not in Siberia very long at all when you went there
the first time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; but I been to Siberia before on practice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let's go back to the conversation that you were having with
Mr. Bouhe about possibility that Oswald might have been sent here by the
Russians for some purpose, that the Russians had devised for him or asked
him to do it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us as best you can recall what the conversation was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, seems to be everybody that hasn't just&mdash;first I talk with
George but then everybody just starting wondering, you know, said why they
taken him back; said that's funny, they should not taken him back, never can
tell what is going happen. George&mdash;one said he don't have any guts to do
anything, not any kind&mdash;he is just man that is silly. We just decided on this
party that he just isn't crazy but&mdash;I don't know how to explain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mental case?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Really not this way but we decided that he just not any count.
He isn't any good. He said he try to be smart; he don't have enough sense.
Said&mdash;they said they going to be through with him. They don't want have anything
to do with him any more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was this conversation carried on in Russian or in English?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. In Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was your husband there at the time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yeah; sometimes we tell him what is going on and he ask me sometimes.
He remember this discussion, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you tell him about the discussion in English or did Mr.
Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, we half way talk in Russian and then we get in on English,
you know, and part what when he interested in something we tell him and he
mostly, he know what we talking about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any other reason for thinking that Oswald might
be a Russian agent other than the fact that he had gotten married to Marina and
left Russia with such ease? Was there any other reason that led you to
suspect he might be an agent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I don't know; I cannot recall it but I cannot&mdash;I don't know how
to tell, that is just my opinion but seems to be he very easy can quit job and
go in Moscow. In Russia that isn't so easy quit job. They send me in Siberia;
I have to stay there. I cannot quit. I cannot go home and stay there and
work. I have to get permission and stay there and working. I imagine he
have permission to go to Moscow, but he seems&mdash;from Minsk going to Moscow;
I don't know what he been doing but not as far as this; other, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you thought that in addition to his apparent&mdash;in addition
to the apparent ease with which he left Russia and the fact he was able to
get married and bring Marina out and also because he was able to move from
Minsk to Moscow, those are three reasons you thought he might be an agent.
Did you have any other reason that led you to believe that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, main things&mdash;I don't thought those things be made him
agent. I thought that's in Russia get better if they let people quit job and
travel and let Marina come back here so easy. I don't thought&mdash;that's main
things he can be as agent but how come this man coming to my mind, Russia
have such a tricks that we thought never can tell what <span class="locked">they&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Will do with him, really; see, I study in college and they don't
need Communists coming to Russia. They need Communists going to other
country and working.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever receive any training or did you know people
who received training in college when you were in Russia to go outside Russia
and be agents for Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; I never received but I do know that we have it in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How do you know; do you have schools like that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; we have school like this and see, my brother been in military
school; he is flyer; he got killed and they do, you know. We study in college,
too, that we have to send people out to work with the people and have organized
Communist party right there. They don't need, you know in Russia them; they
need in other country. They don't want a war; that's as far as they said. We
do not want a war.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The Russians do not want a war?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; they said we do not want to have a war but we let them
have war inside and have revolution and let them destroy themselves, but as far
as fight, we don't want it and we have lots of pictures where they showing
agents sent from other countries in Russia; other countries send it to Russia
and they catch it and they said we have to always be alert and we have to send
trained people over and that's as much as I know, but I don't know if they
send it or they don't send it. I don't know any people I meet here because I really
be cut off. That's first time I meet these people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Where would that school be; do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Which kind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. School where they would teach people this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. That is really secret. They don't let you know. In Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I don't know if they do train agents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were told this when you were going to school in Leningrad,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you finally come to a conclusion in this discussion as to
whether Oswald was probably a Russian agent or probably was not a Russian
agent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; we just decided he just plain not any count; just decided
he just crazy, not really in mind crazy but he try to be smart but we don't have
any conclusion that he is Russian agent but we just been wondering, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In fact, didn't you sort of generally conclude and agree that
because he did not seem to be a responsible person, that he did not seem to have
money that you probably thought he was not a Russian agent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, yes; we said if Russia send some agent here, they do give
him all connection here. He be not without money; he be not without job.
As far as Oswald, he cannot get job. He have such difficulty and usually if
Russia really send it he be don't have any such difficulty. That's what been
discussed and we decided he not Russian agent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you remember any of the other details of these conversations
that you had or have you told us everything that you can recall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; that all I recall right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Other than this one evening that you saw Oswald and his
wife at the Ford party you never saw them at any other time; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No, sir; I never see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know anything else about Oswald that you think
the Commission should know that you have not already told us?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; I don't know nothing else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is there anything else you would like to add to your testimony
you think we should know or do you think we covered it fairly well?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I think you cover it. One thing I want to tell you. When I
saw on television what happened, you know, I recognized him right away and
when my husband come back from work I told him I said, "Honey, do you
know who done it?" It shocked me to know you just met this man; made you
kind of disgusted you even know him and never thought there here a man
what we thought no count can do something like this and when my husband
looking on television, he not remember him. I said, "Well, you remember when
I introduced and tell he has been in Russia" and he said, "I not even know what
he look like him" and that's <span class="locked">much&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you and your husband discuss the possibility after you
saw that Oswald had been arrested in connection with the assassination, did
you discuss the possibility then that Oswald might have been a Russian agent
or didn't you think about that again?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; we not. See, my husband called George Bouhe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. After this happen, yeah; and talking to him on telephone and said,
"George, is that true that's Oswald really done it?" He said, "Well, we try&mdash;just
hear it and everything is still&mdash;." he said, "We just try to figure out; there
we thought he is just don't have any enough guts and then he done things like
this." We just can't figure out that he have anything to do with these things,
but he said they don't hear from him. He had been left from Dallas. Said last
time we been there they quit with him. He give them so much trouble they
just want to forget him. Said, "We don't hear from him" but said that's one
Oswald what, said, you know this party; my husband did not remember and
he thinking I am telling&mdash;am mixed up. I said, "Well, that's Marina, and
this man <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any other questions, Mr. Attorney General.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I think that's all we have at this time. We want to thank
you very much for coming in.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mr. Ray, would you rise and raise your right hand?</p>

<p>(Complying.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give will
be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. My name is Wesley J. Liebeler. I am a member of the legal
staff of the President's Commission investigating the assassination of President
Kennedy. The Commission has authorized staff members to take the testimony
of witnesses pursuant to authority which was granted to the Commission by
Executive Order 11130 dated November 29, 1963, and Joint Resolution of Congress
No. 137. It is my understanding that Mr. Rankin wrote to you and your wife
last week and told you I would contact you to take your testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Enclosed with that letter were copies of the Executive Order and
joint resolution and a copy of the rules of the Commission's procedure relating to
the taking of testimony. Did you receive the letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did it contain copies of the documents I referred to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Technically, the Commission's letter requires the witness to be
given 3 days' notice prior to the time they have to testify although that notice
can be waived. I understand you did not receive the letter until Monday because
it was misdirected to the wrong post office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But I assume you are prepared to go ahead with your testimony
at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I sure am; don't want to come over here again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The testimony we want this time from you relates basically to
some conversations that were had in late 1962 concerning the background of Lee
Harvey Oswald. First of all, would you state your full name for the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Do I have to give my middle name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. If you don't ordinarily use it, you don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Thomas M. Ray.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Thomas M. Ray. What is your address, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Route 3, Detroit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is your employment, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. We have a dairy farm which my wife operates with the help of a
hired hand and my supervision and I also am a commission salesman for Sam
Weiss in Paris who is the consignee of Gulf Oil in Paris, and right now I am
right in the middle of changing my place of employment. I am going on the
road for Paris Milling Co. the 15th of this next month as assistant sales manager
and I have been with Mr. Weiss for about 9½ years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are a native-born American, aren't you, Mr. Ray?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Right; born in Paris, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are married to Natalie Ray, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And your wife is a native of Russia; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us briefly the circumstances under which you
met and married your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, I was stationed in Wiesbaden and as you probably already
know there were a lot of displaced persons over there, and the army used these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
displaced persons for various duties, you know, kitchen work and things like
that and I met her there during the time that she and some other girls came to
work for our outfit. All we had to do was go get them, you know, feed them
and transport them back and forth and feed them and that's where I met her,
in Wiesbaden.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Then you were subsequently married and you brought her
back to the United States; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes, sir; after a length of time during which I was later discharged
there and worked for the U.S. Force headquarters in Frankfurt.</p>

<p>(At this point in the hearing, Mr. Robert T. Davis, assistant attorney general
of Texas leaves the room.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. [continuing]. I was employed there about, well, I think actually
I was on the payroll until they sent me back to New York which would have
been 16, 17 months, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were employed as a civilian is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Civilian employee of the Government.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you an officer or enlisted man; what was your rank
when you met your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Buck sergeant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you incur any difficulty when you tried to marry your
wife when you were in Germany?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. At various times it looked like we were running into stumps but
we got over them. At times it looked like they were going to send all the
Russian nationals back to Russia and I even made a trip to Paris, France,
once to try to talk to the Russian Embassy there and never got to see him.
I think along about that time the Government stepped in and kind of protected
these people that did not want to go back, you know, and things kind of let
up then and we were left about our business for awhile; there after the war,
they were trying to get all the Russian nationals back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did your wife have to obtain the permission of Russian authorities
before she could marry you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I don't think so. Now I'm not sure on that point. I wouldn't say
for sure one way or the other; it has been so long ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was your purpose in going to Paris to try and see the
Russian Embassy, to get permission to keep her here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. To keep her from being sent back to Russia. You know it was
during that time that they were trying to send them all back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did there come a time when you met Lee Harvey Oswald and
his wife, Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I met them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Will you tell us the circumstances surrounding your meeting
them, where was it, what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, do you want to start from the beginning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; just tell us the story in your own words as to how you
came to meet the Oswalds and what happened, what the extent of your contact
was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, I tell you how it happened. This Ed Harris and his wife
that live in Georgetown, his wife had seen a magazine article or something
about my wife and had gotten in touch and they had gotten acquainted and
they had visited us a time or two, you know, and, actually, we knew none of
these people at the party before we came over here. We came and we met
them over here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At the party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; we met them at a hotel and went to the party with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who were the people that you met?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Ed Harris and his wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You had not met the Harrises before you came to Dallas to go
to the Ford party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Oh, yes; I say they were the only people we knew before we went
to this party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The party we are referring to is the party at the home of
Declan P. Ford?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes, and actually the arrangements for us to come along were
made from our home. Mrs.&mdash;Ed's wife, Mrs. Harris&mdash;called Mrs. Ford from our
house and found out, you know, when the party was going to be and made arrangements
to bring us along, or at least told her that we were coming or something.
I don't understand this Russian that goes on when they start talking
Russian. I don't know everything that was said but that's the way we happened
to be at the party. We went along with the Harrises from Georgetown;
at least we met them in Dallas and went to the party with them and that was
the party that was on Friday night and we stayed over Saturday and we
went back to the Ford's on Saturday night and then some&mdash;and visited awhile
and stayed over until Sunday and Sunday afternoon we visited some other people
that were at the party. But the only time I had any contact whatsoever with
Oswald was at the party and frankly, I vaguely remember meeting him because
when there's quite a few people at a party like that you don't get acquainted
with all of them. I got acquainted with a few but I didn't get acquainted with
Oswald or his wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember any conversation that you had with Oswald
at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Nothing at all, no conversation at all, just no more than a handshake
or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You did not form any impression of him that you can remember
at the moment, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No, I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember anything about his wife, Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. The only thing I remember about her is when I met her, she was
kind of small and she didn't speak any English so there I couldn't have any
conversation with her in Russian and that's as far as it went.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you try to talk to her in English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Oh, I might have said a few words but I do not recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It was clear to you that she did not understand English,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, did you notice anything peculiar or out of the ordinary
about Oswald's actions at this party that appeared so to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, frankly, I just didn't pay much attention to the guy. I wasn't
around him very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did there come a time over the weekend either at the Ford
party or following the Ford party where the Oswalds were discussed in your
presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. There was a time, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where was that, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. That was at the home of&mdash;I believe their name is Meller or Miller.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. M-e-l-l-e-r [spelling], would that be right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, now the lady's name was Anna Meller and her husband
<span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would it be T-e-o-f-i-l [spelling]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes; something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who was there at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Of course, we were there, Natalie and I and the Harrises and
Anna Meller and her husband and it seems like this lady from Houston was
there. I believe she was from Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember her name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; I don't now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. B-i-g-g-e-r-s [spelling]; does that ring a bell with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. What was the first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tatiana.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes, I believe she was there that Sunday afternoon. I believe she
was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was anybody else there; do you remember George Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Oh, yeah; George was there. I was trying to think. I got acquainted
with George. He's one I got acquainted with.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember Lydia Dymitruk being there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, I might.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I don't want you to remember if you don't really.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, I don't really right now. I don't really remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us what the conversation about the Oswalds was to the
best of your recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. The thing that I remember most was George telling us what a
nut he was. It seemed that George had tried to help him and I think the Fords
had tried to help him and maybe the Frank Rays or some of this group, you
know, had tried to help him get adjusted and tried to help Mrs. Oswald get
adjusted to the American way of life and frankly, George Bouhe came out and
told me he said he was a damn nut.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you any specific reasons for his opinion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, nothing real specific but it seemed that he wasn't too good
to his wife. He didn't treat her as they thought he should. He wasn't real
good to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Bouhe tell you that Oswald was reported to have beaten
Marina up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I think that came into the conversation, too, and that she had gone
and stayed a couple weeks with somebody. I don't know if it was the Fords
or the Rays or who it was but that I think was the situation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Anyway, as far as you can recall Bouhe indicated that he was
pretty much at the end of his rope as far as Oswald was concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He did not have a very high opinion of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; he did not have a high opinion of Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did anybody else there express an opinion about Oswald along
these lines as far as you can remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, you know, sitting down at a table having coffee and tea and
everybody talks a little but what George said about him impressed me more
than anything else that was said. I am sure that the others did have things
to say but frankly I was not interested in the guy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't have any recollection of what anybody else said
at this point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. At this point I couldn't tell you what anybody else said; no. I am
sure there was a discussion among the group. We were having coffee and cake
and what-not and the subject came up about the Oswalds and that's the way
it went.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you recall any discussion on the question of whether or
not Oswald might be a Russian agent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I don't know whether that was discussed or not. It seems to me
like somebody brought the subject up. It might have been my wife for all I
know but we were wondering since he had left the United States and wanted
to be a Russian citizen and had been over there, the time that he spent in
Russia, why the hell did they let him back in; you know what I mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The United States you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yeah; why did they take him back and how&mdash;the question in my
mind was how did he get his Russian wife out of Russia. It just looked odd
to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was the question in your mind as to how he got his wife out
partly related to the difficulties you had had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I knew the difficulties I had had and of course I have known the
relations between the Americans and the Russians since the war and you know,
the cold war and it cools off and it gets hot and I wondered at the time how the
hell he got his wife out of Russia without so much trouble or maybe he had a
lot of trouble getting her out but it did look odd to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was that subject discussed at this time you can remember
amongst the group there; did George Bouhe offer any opinion on this question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I would say it could have been discussed and I cannot say whether
it was or was not, you know that has been quite some time ago and it's hard
to remember. I think the whole deal was discussed, you know, pretty well.
We might have discussed that. I think we did but I wouldn't say for sure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember if there was a conversation going on in
Russian while you were there or did they speak in English&mdash;the people that
were at the house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Most of it was in English; now I am sure there was some Russian
conversation going on because Ed Harris' wife irritates me to death with her
Russian. If she starts talking to my wife, it's Russian and it just&mdash;I just get
the drift of the conversation and that's all. I mean it is very rude the way she
goes about it. She enjoys talking to Natalie and Natalie enjoys talking to her
in Russian but it kind of leaves Ed and I out when we are together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember whether the group came to any conclusion
on this question as to whether Oswald might have been an agent? I don't want
you to testify to something that you don't remember but do you remember
whether the point was made that Oswald did not appear to have good connections
here and he had trouble getting a job and holding a job and he did not
appear to be a responsible individual and for these reasons, these reasons
would lead you to conclude that he probably was not a Russian agent. Do you
remember any conversation along these lines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. There could have been because I believe that was discussed and I
believe George Bouhe might have said that he was such a nut that the Russians
would not want him or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you say you believe is that that you have a faint recollection
to that effect, is that what you mean when you say you believe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I have a faint recollection of discussing that possibility, see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you say you believe what you are really saying is that it
seems likely that this might have been discussed or it is probable that it was
discussed but you do not have any firm recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; I do not have any firm recollection about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you and your wife have any discussions about the Oswalds
after you left Dallas and went back to Blossom or to Detroit prior to the
assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I am sure we did but at the time of the assassination I had completely
forgotten, you know, that the guy even existed but I am sure we talked
about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't have any recollection of what your conversation
might have been?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I know my wife was concerned because they let him back in the
country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she tell you why she was concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, she was kind of afraid he might be a Russian spy, that they
might have sent him back for something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. She expressed that feeling to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let's go up to the date of the assassination. Do you recall any
conversations with your wife at that time about Oswald's involvement in the
assassination or his alleged involvement in the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, I was working that day, of course, and by the time I got
home it was all on television, you know, and they had captured Oswald and she
had seen his picture on television and she told me that was the guy we met at
the party. I said "What guy?" She said, "Oh, you know, the guy that married
the Russian girl and came back over, you know, brought her back." Well, of
course, I remembered that but she sometimes misunderstands things and I
thought possibly that she could be mistaken, see. She told me "That's the guy
that killed the President. I saw him on television and they said he is the one
that killed the President." Well, I still thought perhaps she could be mistaken
and so the next morning I had her find these names and addresses of these
people and I called this George Bouhe and asked him if that was the guy that
we thought it was. He said "Yes, it was" and we had a short conversation and
he told me he had been out to get a newspaper and said it was all in the papers
and I could read about it. But, at the time I called him he didn't remember me
just right quick. I mean a year had gone by, a year or more had gone by or
maybe it wasn't quite a year or something like that but I had to tell him who I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
was before he remembered me and then of course after he remembered me, well,
he told me "Yeah, that's the guy."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any discussion with Bouhe as to whether or not
Bouhe thought that Oswald was really guilty or really could have been the man
who really did assassinate the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. He said something about that he was trying to figure out how Oswald
could have been at that place at that time and another place at another time.
He couldn't figure how Oswald could have been at all those places in that short
length of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us to the best of your recollection what he said?
Can you remember anything more than that? In other words, at this point
Bouhe expressed some doubt with the stories?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. He expressed some doubt that in that way he could not figure how
Oswald could have been in the building where the gun was fired and then later
killed the policeman so many blocks away. I don't know how many blocks away
it was and later apprehended in <span class="locked">this&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Texas Theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Movie theater. He was trying to figure out how he got from place
to place in a short length of time. There seemed to be a little doubt in his mind
at the time I talked to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he express any doubts as to Oswald's involvement based
on his judgment of Oswald's character? Your wife testified and you did, too,
to some extent that Bouhe was fed up with Oswald and did not think very
much of him, didn't think him very capable or thought he was no account is
the term your wife used. Did you have any discussion with Bouhe at this time
when you talked to him on the phone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I don't know but there was something said about&mdash;now, George was
trying to justify himself in his association with Oswald, see. He said something
about that the only thing he was guilty of was trying to help the guy; do you
know what I mean? He had tried to help the guy when he first came back and
he said, "If that's a crime, I'm guilty." I remember that statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he express any concern as to his own safety or did he tell
you that he thought he was going to have difficulty because of his previous association
with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; he didn't say a word about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you think his statements about being guilty of trying to help
Oswald were just an attempt to justify himself in his own mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I think so; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any subsequent conversation? Have you told us
all now you can remember in your telephone conversation with Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, he said it was all in the paper. "You can read it in the paper",
said "It's all in there."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember if he said anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I don't know it has been so long ago that I don't right now; I don't
remember anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever talk to Bouhe on the telephone again about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. About this deal?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; that was the only time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you seen him at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Haven't seen him since then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you talk to anybody else, or did you talk to anybody else
that was at this party about this assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Saw the Harrises, Ed Harris and his wife. I haven't&mdash;now, that's
the only two people we've seen. I think Mrs. Ford wrote Natalie a letter.
I don't know what the letter said. I wasn't interested but anyway she had
tried to get her on the telephone or something and we did discuss this thing
in Georgetown not too long ago. I had a niece to get married down at Kerrville
so we had to go down to the wedding and on the way back we stopped and spent
a little time at the Harrises and that's&mdash;of course, we discussed it then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you talk with the Harrises about this get-together at
Meller's that occurred after the Ford party at which Oswald was discussed?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I am sure we did; now, I don't really recall. We discussed the
whole durned thing with the Harrises and I am sure that that came into the
conversation but right now, I don't remember exactly when and how it came
about, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, during this conversation with the Harrises was there
any more conversation about Oswald's possibility of being a Russian agent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. That subject always comes up and I am sure it did then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell us the best of your recollection what was said
about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; I cannot because I just don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember whether there was any consensus or agreement
as to whether Oswald probably was or probably was not a Russian agent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, actually I don't think that the Harrises think he was a Russian
agent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did they tell you that they did not think he was; how did you
get that opinion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. If they had told me that they thought he was a Russian agent I
would have remembered it. Do you know what I mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; and you don't have any recollection of them ever telling
you that they thought he was?</p>

<p>(Mr. Davis returns to the hearing.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Or telling you any reasons why they thought he might be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you form an opinion of this question as to whether or not
he was a Russian agent or might be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Just from what little I know about it and the conversation that
we have been over, I think he needed psychiatric treatments or something. I
think he was just a damn nut like George said. Of course, you know a lot of
times that might be the kind of man that they would want, you know, for a
Russian agent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That is <span class="locked">just&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. He might have been smarter than we thought or smarter than the
people that knew him thought; I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That is just your own thought on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. That is my own thoughts on it, see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Have you all&mdash;I might inject here&mdash;have you all gone over the
point&mdash;did you ever discuss with your wife or the Mellers or any of these other
people that it was strange about them being able to come out of Russia so
easily? It was strange about him being able to move about in Russia so
easily? Was it with all of them the consensus that it was unusual; were they
somewhat amazed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I don't know whether they were or not but I was amazed and my
wife was, too, that he went over there and left this country and denounced
his citizenship and then a couple of years later or longer&mdash;how long was he
over there? Anyway, they let <span class="locked">him&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Going on 3 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Come back and bring his wife with him. That looked kind of
ridiculous to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And that question was discussed in your meeting in the Meller's
house and subsequently discussed between you and your wife, wasn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Let me ask you this: This group at the Ford's place where the
Russian-born would tend to get together occasionally, has there been very frequent&mdash;I
mean, have you and your wife gone&mdash;I believe this was the first time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. This was the first time we ever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Did they mention about this having happened fairly frequently
before? Do you know how often they had been meeting in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. It seems like now they kind of get together, you know, somewhere
around New Year's&mdash;Christmas or New Year's; something like an annual affair
for them to get together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Did you know&mdash;were there any others in this group or did you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
have any occasion to hear from any others that had a similar story like the
Oswalds where they had found it that easy to go and come or go out of Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No, no; see, most of these people are, the way I get it, were Russian
descent or else they were like&mdash;they had married a Russian over there or something
of that nature, you see. I mean it wasn't everybody there wasn't Russian
but there was some Russian connection with most of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you heard of no other examples where people had come
out of Russia as easily as Oswald had; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You know or did you hear of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I did not hear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Has your wife or you or have you all heard of anyone since the
time he came out where it has been easier for people to come and go? I believe
your wife mentioned she thought it would be easier to contact her niece
if conditions were easing up to that degree. Has this proved to be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I don't know; 2 or 3 years ago she tried to call her niece on the
telephone and tried 2 or 3 days and finally made the connection and the niece
said, "Hello," and the line was out like that and she finally gave up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. In other words, to your knowledge you have seen no evidence it
has been made easier to communicate back and forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. No; fact of the business, my wife's mother had been dead a couple
years before we even knew it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. How long has this been you received that information?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I think she died in 1953; I know it was a couple years gone by when
my wife found out about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was your wife's mother living in Stalingrad when she died, do
you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I don't know. She was, I believe, in Arzamas; I am not sure that's
where she died but that's near Stalingrad, some place near Stalingrad and that's
where at least part of my wife's upbringing, you know, took place, in Arzamas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you think now that you have told us about all you know or
all you remember about your contact with Oswald and the discussion that you
had about him? If there is anything you want to add at this point, go right
ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I think we pretty well covered it. I hope you have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. We want to thank you very much, Mr. Ray, for coming down
here and I think you have been helpful and I appreciate it very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. Well, like I said before, I went to the FBI voluntarily with what
information that I had. Frankly, I didn't know anything about the guy except
what I have told you but I did have the names and addresses of some of these
people that knew him and that's why I went to the FBI, because of that. They
might contact these people and find out more about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I think they have talked to most of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ray</span>. I am sure they have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<h2 id="sbb">TESTIMONY OF SAMUEL B. BALLEN</h2>

<p>The testimony of Samuel B. Ballen was taken at 2:20 p.m., on March 24, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Wesley J. Liebeler, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you raise your right hand to be sworn, Mr. Ballen?
Do you solemnly swear that you will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth, in the testimony you are about to give?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. My name is Wesley J. Liebeler. I believe Mr. Rankin mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
in the letter he sent to you last week that I would contact you this week to take
your testimony.</p>

<p>The Commission has authorized me to take your testimony pursuant to authority
granted by Executive Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963, and Joint
Resolution of Congress 137.</p>

<p>Copies of those documents have been sent to you as well as a copy of the
Commission's rules of procedure in the taking of testimony. You did receive
those, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. We want to ask you about your somewhat limited contacts with
Lee Harvey Oswald, and also inquire to some extent about your association with
George De Mohrenschildt.</p>

<p>Will you state your full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Samuel B. Ballen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is your address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. 8715 Midway Road.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Dallas 9.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is your employment, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. I am a financial consultant, self-employed, and I am senior
officer in several corporations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Included among those corporations is the High Plains Natural
Gas Co. and Electrical Log Services, Inc.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are an American citizen, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you born here in the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. In New York City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you move to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. November 1950.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is your age, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Forty-two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us briefly your educational background?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. I went to public schools in New York. Attended Townsend Harris
High; attended C.C.N.Y.; received a BBA Degree from C.C.N.Y., and then have
also taken extension courses at Columbia University, Manhattan College, NYU
Graduate School of Banking, Oklahoma University, and Texas A&amp;M.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What were the graduate courses in, generally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Three fields. Money and banking; geology; and petroleum engineering.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did there come a time when you made the acquaintance of Lee
Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Will you tell us the circumstances surrounding that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. In some respects, my memory is still a little bit hazy.</p>

<p>My best recollection though is that in the fall of 1962, George De Mohrenschildt,
a close friend of mine, told me that he and his wife had met an extremely
interesting couple who had worked their way from Russia here to Dallas and
Fort Worth, and that among other problems, that this fellow was in pretty
desperate financial straits and needed a job, and would I be willing to see him
and try to find employment for him.</p>

<p>I said, "Yes." And he came down to my office and I spent approximately
2 hours with him.</p>

<p>He came down, and I left my office in the Southland Center with him to go
to a meeting at the Republic National Bank, and walked down with him, and
he then left and I believe stated that he was going over to the YMCA where
he was residing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you fix the date of this meeting with any precision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. I can't. I think it was either the latter part of 1962 or the very
early part of 1963.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
I know the particular day was pleasant, because I recall walking down the
street not wearing any topcoat, just wearing a regular coat, and that was also
true of Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald have a job at the time he came to talk to you; do
you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. He indicated to me that he was not employed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He told you he was living at the YMCA in Dallas, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. That's correct. He told me that his&mdash;I knew he had a wife and
child, and he indicated that his wife was staying with some friends, and his
child, but he at that time was working out of the YMCA.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you where his wife was staying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No. I would have had some vague idea about that from the
De Mohrenschildts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have an idea from De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. I had the idea that they were either moving into or just coming
out of some apartment, and I would have an idea, which is very vague and not
too accurate, that this may have been somewhere in the Oak Cliff region.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald tell you anything about his previous employment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Just during the course of my trying to be helpful to him and of
trying to see what skills he had so that I could try to develop some employment
for him.</p>

<p>He did say that he had some training in the U.S.S.R., in some area in the field
of photography&mdash;no, some area in the field of reproduction, but the thing that
I was impressed about in talking with him was his lack of any usable training.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is the state of your recollection that Oswald told you he
had received training in photography when he was in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Pretty vague, but I had the feeling that he said he may have
worked in some capacity, either in a house organ&mdash;or a newspaper in the U.S.S.R.,
and that he did have some training and knew how to use commercial camera
equipment and general reproduction equipment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you take any steps to help Oswald get a job as a result
of his interview with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No. During the course of my meeting with him, I started out
being attracted somewhat toward him, and I started out having a fairly good
impression of the individual, and I also started out feeling very sorry for the
chap, knowing some hard times that he had been through, and of wanting to
help him. But as this meeting wore on, I just gradually came to the feeling
that he was too much of a rugged individualist for me, and that he was too
much of a hardheaded individual, and that I probably would ultimately regret
having him down at my organization. I was, during the course of this meeting,
trying to analyze his training to find a place for him at Electrical Log Services,
where we have a large camera and commercial reproduction equipment, but the
more I talked to him, while I had a certain area of admiration for him, it still
remained that I gradually came to the conclusion, and did not relay this to him
in any way, that he was too much of a rugged individualist and probably
wouldn't fit in with the team we had down there. So I never did really try to
help Oswald. I think I told George De Mohrenschildt I would search around
and see what I could do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But in point of fact, you never took any steps after this to try
to help him find a job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. My memory was a bit hazy in one respect. I knew I reached my
conclusion. I didn't know whether I had called up our general manager down
at the Log Services to see what openings, if any, could be generated, but in
checking with the individual, he does not have any memory of my calling him
in that regard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The other individual being the man in charge of operations at
Log Services?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did Oswald say to you that led you to this conclusion
that you have just expressed?</p>

<p>Let me ask you a broader question. Let me ask you, if you will now, to your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
best recollection, give the substance of the conversation that you and Oswald
had that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. We commenced speaking in pleasantries, and I had known from
De Mohrenschildt that he had gone to Russia, that he had married, and come
back. I did not know of any unpleasant association with the Marine Corps, nor
did I know of any attempt on his part to be a defector.</p>

<p>I asked him why he had left and gone to Russia, and he said that this Russian
movement was an intriguing thing and he wanted to find out for himself and
didn't want to depend upon what the newspapers or visitors had said, and that
he had gone there and spent some time there. He gave me the impression
somehow that this was in the southern portion of Russia. And he said that the
place was just boring, that there was hardly anything of any real curiosity or
interest there.</p>

<p>I had gotten the feeling, and I don't know how specific I can make this, but
all of his comments to me about Russia were somewhat along a negative vein.
He said nothing to me that would indicate that he still had any romantic feeling
about Russia. His comments to me seemed to be fairly realistic.</p>

<p>Some time as we talked on, he displayed somewhat the same type of detached
objective criticism towards the United States and our own institutions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you remember anything specifically that he said along
that line?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. I don't believe I can recall anything specific, but there were
just during the entire course of this 2 hours, general observations, general
smirks, general slurs that were significant to me that he was equally a critic
of the United States and of the U.S.S.R., and that he was standing in his
own mind as somewhat of a detached student and critic of both operations, and
that he was not going to be snowed under by either of the two operations,
whether it be the press or official spokesmen.</p>

<p>He would have displayed pretty much to me a plague-on-both-your-houses
type of viewpoint, but the one thing that greatly started to rub me the wrong
way is, as I started to seriously think through possible industrial openings or
possible people I could refer him to, and he could see I was really making an
effort in this respect, he kept saying, and then he repeated himself a little too
often on this, he said to me, "Now, don't worry about me, I will get along.
Don't you worry yourself about me." He said that often enough that gradually
it became annoying and I just felt this is a hot potato that I don't think
will fit in with any organization that I could refer him to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever demonstrate or indicate to you any particular
hostility toward any official of the U.S. Government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. None whatsoever; none whatsoever. My own subjective reaction
is, that the sum total of these 2 hours that I spent with him, I just
can't see his having any venom towards President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did President Kennedy come up in any way during the course
of your discussion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No; it did not. The sum total of his reaction, limited as it
was that I got from this individual, is that this man would have&mdash;this is
subjective, I can put no concrete support in there, but I would have thought
that this is an individual who felt warmly towards President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You drew that inference simply as a general impression based
on the 2 hours that you spent conversing with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Could you&mdash;and you can't pinpoint anything specifically that
led you to that conclusion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any discussion, or was the name of Governor
Connally mentioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No; it was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald manifest any hostilities toward any particular
institution of the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Yes. I think he had referred sarcastically to some of our religious
institutions, or all religious institutions, and I think he referred with
some venom and sarcasm to some race prejudices in the United States. I cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
document that with any specific items which were discussed, but it is
pretty strongly a general feeling that this had come out during that discussion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was it discussed in terms of the Negro race problem?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Negro and all forms of human hatred. In other words, the
meeting that I had with this individual, which was very limited. I had a
certain element of attraction towards the man because I felt that this man did
express, at least in an intellectual vein, feeling of compassion for mankind
generally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate that he was not in accord with policies which
had as their end racial prejudice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Yes. In his general categoric manner, he would have felt
that this was a form of stupidity as well as a form of injustice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there any specific discussion, as you can recall, of any extremists
groups or so-called "hate" groups?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you form any impression of the man that would enable
you to make a judgment as to the extent to which he would be influenced by
racist or hate propaganda?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. You will have to make your question more specific.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you think that Oswald was the kind of person who would
be influenced, by propaganda or by people who were associated with, say racist
or extremist groups, to engage in any particular kind of activity? You mentioned
before, for example, that Oswald took the position or expressed the
attitude that as far as the Soviet Union and the United States generally were
concerned, it was a sort of plague-on-both-the-houses, he was not going to let
anyone substitute their judgment for what he regarded as the basic reality
of the situation. Did you gain any impression about Oswald's attitude toward
hate groups? Do you think he could have been moved or motivated by them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. I think I understand your question, and there would have been
no expression advanced by Oswald of contempt for a particular organization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate that he had experienced certain difficulties in
securing or holding employment because of his trip to the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Yes; he said he ran into difficulty, and that he was not ashamed
of his background and wasn't going to conceal it, and that in this particular
geographic area that he was just finding it hard as heck to gain employment.</p>

<p>I could understand that, and I said, "Well, let's see what kind of training
you have, if you get employment."</p>

<p>And I was struck with almost a total lack of any meaningful training other
than what he had mentioned which I have already covered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you any specific details of the kind of work he
did in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. I have the impression that these were menial jobs. I am sure
I discussed it with him. I am sure I would have asked him, and I have the
impression that he had menial jobs, and that he would have worked in some
kind of publication function, and he had learned about camera and reproduction
equipment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you how much he was paid?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. He did say that the economics there were awfully tight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you recall specifically his mentioning any figure as to what
his income was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate in any way that he had received income while
he was in the Soviet Union from sources other than this&mdash;his job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No; he didn't indicate anything like that. I did express a little
puzzlement as to how he was able to get out with his wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did he say about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. He shrugged that off and said, "Well, it's just a matter of sticking
with it with the necessary bureaucrats, both Russian and the United States,
of staying with the necessary bureaucrats to get out; and I got out."</p>

<p>I would add this. Jeanne De Mohrenschildt was making a serious effort to
help out socially and economically the Oswalds, and she was reporting to us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
that on given evenings the De Mohrenschildts were visiting with the Oswalds,
and that their whole life was pretty miserable. They were just sitting alone
in the apartment and looking at each other and fighting with each other, and
that it was necessary to bring these two people out into the fresh air and have
them meet people and mingle and otherwise.</p>

<p>George asked me and also asked my wife to invite the Oswalds to our house
for dinner and help these people out. This was a type of thing that we have done
quite frequently, but there must have been something in my report to my wife
about my meeting with this chap that my wife didn't pick up this suggestion,
and never did extend that invitation to the Oswalds. In other words, my wife
has never met either one of them, but based upon this meeting and the final
impressions that I had of this chap is that we just didn't want to be involved
with him. He was too independent a thinker. I am not talking on politics
now. And my wife never did extend that invitation to them, which she otherwise
would have done, as we have done to many, many people who recently
moved into Dallas from afar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you remember with any great specificity the things that
Oswald said or did that led you to the conclusion that he was such an independent
fellow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. It was his overall mannerism, and he would have, did have, a
habit of closing off discussion on a given subject by a shrug of the shoulders;
and it was just an overall impression that I ended up with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald indicate to you that he had traveled within the
Soviet Union in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. I had the impression that he had done considerable traveling
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember whether he told you that, or how did you
get that information or impression?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. I think he told me that he had traveled in the Soviet Union and
finally ended up in a southwestern town and life was just incredibly boring
and dismal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you go into any details as to how the life was boring or
dismal in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No. This was my first visit with him and I knew he came down
to see me in order to talk about a job, and I didn't want to impose on him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you question him&mdash;did you have questions in your own
mind as to where he obtained the funds to do this traveling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. I had the impression that this was the kind of guy who could
travel from one end of the continent to the other with very little money. He
was dressed very modestly, and I, at least to me, he did, engender a certain
amount of sympathy.</p>

<p>In other words, the type of fellow that you would feel sorry for, and if he
were hitchhiking, you might buy him a meal or something like that. I just had
the feeling that this was a fellow who could get around and make his way and
find his way and not require any sum of money to do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is there any other thing that led you to that conclusion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No; I am sorry. I don't know more specifically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever lend Oswald any money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No; I didn't. If at the time he had asked me to loan him money,
I would have. But I would say that this would, that the thing that he kept
impressing on me to the point where it just rubbed me the wrong way is, that
he kept insisting, raising his voice a little bit; "Don't you worry about me, I will
take care of myself, and I will get myself work, don't you worry about me."
Telling that too many times to a prospective employer isn't quite the best
technique.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have testified that Oswald told you that he had received
some training in the use of photographic equipment when he was in the Soviet
Union. Did he mention any other training that he received in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No; I think I discussed a little detail with him about photography,
continuous cameras and things like that, and he stated that he could operate
most of the machinery we had down at Ross Avenue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate to you a general comprehension and understanding
of that type of machinery?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. I am not that familiar technically with the equipment myself
to have gone into any explicit detail, but I mentioned different types of machinery,
the M-4, blueprint machines, Repco continuous cameras, and he said yes,
he could operate all those machines.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any discussion concerning his wife, Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever meet Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you speak Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald ever tell you that he had been in the hospital when
he was in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Other than the fact that he stated that life in the Soviet Union
was very boring, did he indicate to you any reason for his return to the United
States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Yes; he said that he had gone there to find out what this thing
was like. He wanted to find it out for himself. He found out, and now was
the time to come back, and that coming back he was running into all the prejudices
of the people here who were washing him off because he had taken this
plunge and gone on his own initially to the U.S.S.R.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know at that time that he had attempted to renounce
his citizenship?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. I did not know it, and he did not say anything that would have
suggested that. You must bear in mind he came to me to look for a job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he mention the name of the city in which he was employed
and lived in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. He probably did, and I can't really recall it. I read so much
in the newspaper, I don't know on that what is my own memory and what I
have read in the newspaper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have read in the newspaper that he lived and was employed
in the city of Minsk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. That is correct. I would have thought that he would have&mdash;my
memory is this. He told me he was in a community outside of Minsk.
That is my best memory, but it is not too good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you what kind of living quarters he had while in
the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No; I didn't ask him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you anything about meeting and marrying his
wife when he was in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As far as his return to the United States is concerned, you
previously testified that you asked Oswald how he managed to leave Russia,
and he said it was just a matter of sticking with the bureaucrats. Did he
specify hostility towards the bureaucrats or any resentment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Yes; just in the sense that these were fellows who made life
uncomfortable and detracted from the personal freedom of the human being.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he have that attitude toward both the American and
Russian authorities? Do you remember any specific conversation relating to
possible resentment of the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember that he did indicate to you that the Americans
were just as much responsible for delaying his return as Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No; I wouldn't have gotten that feeling; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You got the feeling that it was primarily the Russians who
had delayed his return, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Well, it was a matter of working then through these bureaucrats
and the American bureaucrats. This would be his reaction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you say he expressed more resentment of the American
bureaucracy or the Russian bureaucracy, or were they about the same?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. I would say about equal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any discussion with Oswald concerning politics?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Not in addition to what I have already alluded to, parenthetically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald tell you anything about his educational background?
About where he had gone to grade school or high school and that sort of thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. I am sure I questioned him on that, and the ultimate conclusion
I came to was that he left&mdash;that he lacked educational training.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you that he had been employed by a newspaper
in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. I think he told me that his knowledge of reproduction facilities
had been refreshened by recent employment in New Orleans, and the&mdash;in
the photographic field, but this employment, I thought in New Orleans, would
have been in a printing shop rather than a newspaper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you remember any of the details of what he told you
about his activities in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. That would have been the only reference to New Orleans, and
he said nothing whatsoever about any involvement with any Cuban committees
or anything like that. I would have the feeling that this was a man who was
at that stage a political, had no involvement with any Communist group, that
he washed his hands pretty much of anyone or any part of the political spectrum.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You did not know that he was a professed Marxist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. He may have&mdash;I think I had the feeling that he, to the extent
that he could define it, that he was a student of Marxism and was a critic of
societies along Marxist lines.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you led to that belief partly by his remarks about religion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No; I learned that from George De Mohrenschildt, and I think
Oswald would have, somewhere along the line during my interview with him,
made statements to reenforce that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember what De Mohrenschildt told you about Oswald
before you actually met Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Yes; he said that this was a very unusual situation, sir. Here
is a chap who suddenly appears in the Dallas area, and that he had been to
Russia, went to Russia, came back, and has no hatred either for Russia or
for the United States, and is just a man with no hatred, and by gosh here he
appears in the United States, having gotten out of Russia with a wife, and
that this was an independent and truth seeking young man and very interesting,
and George was talking to him at length in Russian, and someone just
totally unlike anyone else who came back who was either very much pro and
very much anti, and this is a fellow with no hatred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did De Mohrenschildt indicate to you that Oswald had no
hatred of anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. That is what&mdash;De Mohrenschildt had emphasized it to me that
his view of this man was that the chap wasn't getting involved with hatred and
was outside the cold war on either side and his emotions connected with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was De Mohrenschildt's opinion borne out in your mind when
you met and talked to Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Based on that 2-hour visit with him, to a certain extent; yes.
But I would express it rather than Oswald not having hatred, that he would
have had a little disdain for both sides.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You did not get the impression, however, that he was emotionally
involved in any significant extent with either of the two sides? Would
that be a fair statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Definitely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you also have the impression that Oswald would not be
influenced against the Soviet Union by anti-Soviet Union propaganda that
might be disseminated in the country?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Definitely he would make the decisions for himself and would
consider himself much more of an expert than anyone in the United States,
including our Government.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You would say that Oswald would not likely be influenced by
propaganda of this sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. He forms his own conclusion in his own way, and he didn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
appear to me, either by his use of language or any other reference, to be particularly
informed, particularly learned, but he did impress me as a man who
was going to make up his own mind in this own way, and these tendencies were
so pronounced that I felt I didn't want to involve him in my firm, which means
a team operation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald appear to be a particularly intelligent person or
did you form an opinion as to his intelligence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. I thought he was of above average intelligence, and the unusual
thing that struck me as being particularly unusual was the degree to which
he would go for self-education and self-improvement. It was this quality&mdash;these
qualities which attracted him somewhat to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he appear to be in any way mentally unstable?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Appeared to be just a little too much a hard head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What makes you say that, Mr. Ballen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Too much a hard head?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes, sir; what do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. I&mdash;just his general conduct, his general responses, general bearing.
He just seemed to be a little too aloof from society, and just seemed to
know all things and everything a little too affirmatively, a little too dogmatically,
but as far as feeling that he was mentally ill, I didn't come away with
that feeling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember any specific example of his efforts at self-improvement
or self-education that you could give us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Well, he just indicated a wide range of readership, literature,
and the fact that, my impression was one of a little curiosity, a chap out of
Fort Worth who would go to the point of reading and becoming familiar with
Marxian literature just struck me as someone who was displaying more than
the normal amount of initiative.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know at that time that he had received Marxian
literature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Yes; I think I knew even in his offhanded reference to comments
on those that he was using Marxian terminology.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You think he had Marxian leanings to the extent he understood
them to be Marxian leanings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. I think he considered himself a Marxist, and what exactly his
understanding of that philosophy was, I didn't have an opportunity to go into
that with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember being interviewed by the FBI about December
10, 1963, in connection with your acquaintance with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Was that the FBI or the Secret Service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, agents Kesler and
Mitchell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Yes; I recall being interviewed, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember that he questioned you whether you were
familiar or knew of Oswald's Marxist leanings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. I had a conversation with them pretty much the same as I have
been having with you, and I suppose that question came up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember what your answer was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No, sir; I don't remember what my answer was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you recall that you told the two agents that you were
unaware that Oswald had Marxist leanings, and that in a great deal of the
conversation Oswald was critical of Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. The difficulty in this thing is in trying to be objective on a conversation
which occurred quite some time ago. In reading the newspapers&mdash;all
I can say in answer to that is, that I am giving the best answer now to my
memory and I gave the best answer then, to my memory? I have greater faith
in my response today than in December.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are not conscious of any difference in those two answers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Oh, yes; I can see that my answer on that day is not the same
as my answer here today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Assuming that was your answer that day?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. If that was my answer that day, that would have been my best
memory and best recollection at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know anything about the relationship between Oswald
and De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. I knew that George had met this fellow. In the events after
November 22d, the question came up in my own mind how did George meet
this fellow. Prior to November, I didn't know how George met this fellow.
George meets all kinds of individuals. He is a magnet for individuals who
are not run-of-the-mill. I knew that George and his wife were making an
effort to help out the Oswalds, and I think that this effort continued pretty
near up until the time when they were leaving for Haiti.</p>

<p>George and his wife were visiting my home two or three or four times a
week, and we played tennis two or three or four times a week. Sometimes
more than that. And I know that quite frequently they came to our house at
9:00 or so in the evening and they would have just come from the Oswalds,
trying to cheer them up. "And those poor souls are looking at the wall and
fighting each other."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember that on or about April of 1963, there was
an attempt made on the life of General Walker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever discuss that with George De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Not in any detail. We may have. George and I would discuss
either in a joking way or serious way pretty near everything that occurred.
I'm sure we would have discussed that also and made some pleasantry about
it, but I don't recall and doubt if I ever discussed it with him in any <span class="locked">great&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did De Mohrenschildt ever mention Oswald's name to you in
connection with the attempt on Walker's life?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. None whatsoever. I don't think he ever mentioned it to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have no recollection that he did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did De Mohrenschildt ever mention to you that Oswald owned
a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald mention in his conversation with you the fact that
he was a member of a hunting club while he was in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there any mention of any kind of firearms of any kind
in that conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was the time that Oswald came to your office the first time
that you met him, or had you met him previous to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. If I had met him previously, it would have been on a Sunday
morning in the De Mohrenschildt's household for a period of time of about
40 minutes, but I am about satisfied, in talking to other people, that the individual
I met on that Sunday morning was not Oswald, but some other stray
dog.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember who this other stray dog was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. I don't know his name. This was someone who had worked his
way here either from Hungary or Bulgaria.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And subsequently disappeared from the scene?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. I don't know his name. This was one of the individuals De
Mohrenschildt had latched on to for a period of 4 or 5 or 6 weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you surprised when you learned that Oswald had been
arrested in connection with the assassination of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. When I first heard of Oswald's arrest, I didn't realize that this
was the chap I had met. It only dawned upon me about 2 or 3 hours later that
this was the chap I met.</p>

<p>I told my wife that evening that there must have been some mistake, that I
didn't believe that chap was capable of this kind of thing, and she said, what do
you mean? She said they picked him up and got the gun. I said Oswald wasn't
that sort of guy. I told my wife that if you lined up 50 individuals, the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
person who would stand out as being suspicious or strange would be Lee
Harvey Oswald, but I was very surprised when Oswald was arrested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any further conversations along that line with
your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Well, as this story developed day by day, we would naturally
discuss it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you still have the same view that you expressed to your
wife when you first learned of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. I want to read the report that I assume the Warren Commission
will ultimately publish. The circumstantial evidence as reported in the press is
overwhelming, to say the least, but there remains a shadow of skepticism in my
mind, and I am looking forward to seeing the published report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It would certainly be fair to say, however, would it not, Mr.
Ballen, that you at no time prior to the assassination had any reason to believe
that Oswald was capable or would be inclined to commit an act of this sort, is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know of any contact between Oswald and Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. None whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you first meet George De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Approximately 1955, maybe 1954.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you had any conversation with De Mohrenschildt since
this assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Only through the mails.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have corresponded with him since the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you write about the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Only in a very guarded way, because I understood that mails in
Haiti are subject to scrutiny, and I didn't know what his environment was down
there, so I only corresponded with him in a very guarded way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell me in general what you wrote to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. I made no reference to the assassination directly. I said in one
letter that I wanted to hear from him. I was&mdash;I wanted to know that he was
okay. I didn't use those words in the letter, but he understood what I was
asking him.</p>

<p>And I said it was a shame that he had to leave Dallas, that if he and Jeanne
had remained here, that possibly this never would have happened, because they
were the only people who were trying to bring this closed mind out into the
open air.</p>

<p>And I received one reply back from George's wife, and she thanked me for
what she thought were kind sentiments.</p>

<p>Subsequently he chided me a little bit, and I again wrote to him and let him
know I wondered how he was getting along.</p>

<p>And he wrote back and said, "I am fearful about you, all kinds of race riots
and assassinations in Dallas, but how are you getting along? Let us hear from
you."</p>

<p>Subsequently, as you know, his wife's daughter and son-in-law were guests in
my house for 2 weeks, and so I learned from them about George and his wife,
and I am about due another letter in the next week or so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you keep copies of the letters you wrote to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you still have the letters he wrote to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No; I first started to save his letters when he and his wife
walked through Central America, and this was a collection of letters, but I am
not a letter saver. But I did save them, saved them until he returned from his
trip and gave them all to him, and those are the only letters that I have ever
saved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned De Mohrenschildt's daughter-in-law?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Well, his wife's daughter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. His wife's daughter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What are their names?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Rags and Chris Bogoiavlensky-Kearton. And the De Mohrenschildts
call them Buggers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You say that Rags and Chris stayed at your house for a period
of time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long, approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. About 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. They originally resided in Anchorage, Alaska, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Well, that is where they formerly resided; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have they permanently moved from Anchorage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Your guess is as good as mine is. I received a letter from him
this morning. They are in Philadelphia on their way to New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether or not these two people, Rags and Chris,
ever knew Lee Harvey Oswald or Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. They say they had not, and in thinking through the chronology of
events, I am satisfied that they did not. There was some confusion in my mind
in my interview with the FBI about the individual who Rags and Chris did know,
and whom they went out of their way to try to help.</p>

<p>They drove him to east Texas once and to a timber farm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was this the other person whom you described a little while
back as another stray dog?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. While Rags and Chris stayed at your house, did you have any
discussions with them as to what the De Mohrenschildts had said about the
assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. They were very upset that George and Jeanne were publicly
stating in Port-au-Prince that the FBI had assassinated Kennedy, and that
Oswald was a patsy, and we were very upset because they apparently had no
basis for such a statement, and it wasn't very wise for them to be banding
about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Am I correct in understanding you to say that Rags and Chris
reported to you that De Mohrenschildt and his wife were saying publicly in
Port-au-Prince that the FBI was responsible for the assassination of Kennedy
and Oswald was a patsy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. They told me that they stated that at a reception for members
of the Foreign Diplomatic Corps in Port-au-Prince.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you when that reception was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. It would have been while Chris and Rags were in Haiti.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Rags and Chris tell you they heard De Mohrenschildt
make this remark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. That was the impression I had, but I couldn't answer your
question directly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Will you fix for me more specifically, if you can, the dates that
Rags and Chris were in Port-au-Prince?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. This is March. I believe that Rags and Chris came through my
house possibly the first week of December 1963. They stayed at my house one
night. We had quite a bit of snow that night. They had come through in a
mad rush from Alaska. They left Florida for Haiti, and they left Haiti about
a week prior to showing up at my house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did they show up at your house again for the second
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. They left my house 2 Sundays ago, and they would have been
at my house a total of 2 weeks. They would have arrived at my house at about
March 2, something like that. They would have arrived at my house March 1,
and left March 15, more or less.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Will you state for us, as best you can recall, the conversations
that you had with Rags and Chris concerning these remarks allegedly made by
De Mohrenschildt while they stayed at your house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. This information was brought to me by Rags and Chris that
they were very much upset about it. And I told Rags that probably all of
George's mail was being intercepted in and out, and that I felt that sooner or
later he would be called before the Warren Commission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
The FBI had already interviewed me, I told Rags, and that distressed him a
little bit that the FBI was probably intercepting his mail and probably had a
tail on him.</p>

<p>He thought I was kidding, and I said, no; that this was a pretty serious item
and that probably he was under surveillance, and so he then took the initiative
to call the FBI and said if they wanted to see him, he was out there, and he
would be leaving for parts unknown, and so they came out to my house and
interviewed him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether Rags told the FBI about the remarks
that De Mohrenschildt was alleged to have made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. I do not. I was out of the house when the FBI agent was there,
but I kept myself elsewhere in that building, not in the room where they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know the name of the agent who came out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. He was one of the agents who interviewed me from California.
Had a very nice tan, but I don't know his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. One of the two agents that interviewed you when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. About March 6th or 7th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The interview that you have just referred to concerns your
acquaintanceship with De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would it refresh your recollection if I advised you that the
names of the agent that interviewed you were W. James Wood and Raymond
P. Yelchek?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. The gentleman who came out to my house was Mr. Wood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It was Mr. Wood that interviewed Rags, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Rags discuss with you the interview after the agent had
left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Rags tell you anything about his conversations with De
Mohrenschildt after De Mohrenschildt had allegedly made this remark that
the FBI was responsible for the assassination of the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Just to the extent that he or Chris had protested vigorously on
politics generally with George, and as I had already known before Rags came
to my house, the visit in Haiti had deteriorated into quite a personality clash.</p>

<p>I had gotten a letter from George which showed that he was very critical on
personal grounds of Rags.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Why was De Mohrenschildt critical of Rags, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. These are personal matters, and I am just asking a question
now. Is it within the realm of your interest? These are really personal matters
between one individual and a somewhat removed son-in-law, a son-in-law of
his wife, and, so, I wrote back to George and said that his anger was only
natural, that the Navajos had a taboo against sons seeing their mother-in-law
in pains of having their eyes removed, and maybe the Navajos know what they
are talking about.</p>

<p>But to answer your question, the discussion in that matter was on a personal
matter, and I really do not think it has anything&mdash;any bearing here. If you
want me to discuss it, I will.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. No; if you represent to me that the differences were of a purely
personal matter, that is sufficient for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. With only one exception, and that is that George, by his overall
nature, is leaning to left center, and Rags, by his overall nature, leans to the
right of center, and just among other things this was one of the sources of some
conflict.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. They had political differences, in other words, also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. In their overall perspective; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you told us everything that you can remember about your
conversations with Rags concerning these statements by De Mohrenschildt that
the FBI was responsible for the assassination? Tell us everything about that
that you can remember, either about your conversation with Rags, or what
Rags told you about his conversation with De Mohrenschildt, and the reactions
of other people to De Mohrenschildt's statements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. He or Chris said that the American Embassy down there was
very disturbed that George, at a cocktail party possibly run by, well, I think by
someone in the Foreign Corps there, whether it be the French, that George or
Jeanne had made this statement, and it was a foolish thing for him to say and
a distressing thing, and I think also at that party there was a Negro emissary
from one of the newly free republics in Africa who told the Haitians that if
Haiti is the result of 300 years of freedom, he would like to go back to French rule.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Rags specifically mention the names of anybody else who
was at this party, that you can remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No; I don't think so. And if he had, it wouldn't rest with me.
This was one of numerous cocktail parties down there.</p>

<p>I had the impression, from what Rags said, that this was George's statement
and was known to the American Embassy down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember what Rags said about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. That it was distressing to the American Embassy, and that
George and Jeanne were kind of a thorn in the side of the American Embassy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Rags indicate whether or not De Mohrenschildt had been
interviewed by the FBI while he was living in Port-au-Prince?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Yes; George had said to me in one of his letters that he had had
a previous visit with the FBI, and then subsequently Mr. Wood&mdash;was that his
name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mr. Wood was the gentleman who interviewed Rags.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. He subsequently; yes, subsequently I believe Mr. Wood indicated
that he had gone down there and also had met George.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mr. Wood indicated that to you at some point in his interview
of you, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No; after his interview with me he indicated to Chris and Rags
that he had just the day before or 2 days before seen George and Jeanne previously
at the American Embassy at Port-au-Prince and they were looking fine.</p>

<p>But prior to that, much prior to that, I had written to George and told him
that I had received a visit from the FBI inquiring about him. And he wrote
back to me and said that he also had a previous visit from the gray flannel suit
boys.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He didn't tell you any details of his conversation with the
FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Based on your knowledge of De Mohrenschildt and your knowledge
of De Mohrenschildt's relations with Oswald, do you have any reason
whatsoever to believe that De Mohrenschildt could have been involved in the
assassination in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. None whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you discussed this matter with anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Would you make your question a little more specific?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you discussed with anybody the possibility of De Mohrenschildt's
possible involvement in any way in the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Only to the extent that on November 23, when I realized that
I had known Oswald and I realized how I had met him, my wife and I then
said, how in heck did George meet him and that George had better have a
good answer to that one.</p>

<p>And during the ensuing months I have made inquiries of the Russian colony
here and kind of came to the understanding that George had met him through
George Bouhe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you speak to Mr. Bouhe about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No; I haven't seen George Bouhe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember who told you that De Mohrenschildt and
Oswald had met through Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. It would have either been Declan Ford or Natasha Voshinin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you discuss with any of these people the possibility that
De Mohrenschildt might have had something to do with the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you heard anybody else discuss that question?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No; it is question that to us would be so absurd; that is, the
first time I have heard that question raised is today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yet you did say to your wife, as you have just testified, when
you heard that, when you recalled that Oswald was the man that De Mohrenschildt
had introduced you to, you said to your wife De Mohrenschildt had
better have a good answer as to how he met Oswald; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In your letters with De Mohrenschildt or through the contact
that you had with De Mohrenschildt through Rags and Chris, did you learn
what the last contact was that De Mohrenschildt had with Oswald prior to
the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No; this was not discussed with any of them. I have the feeling
that the contacts would have been fairly continuous up to their leaving
Dallas for Haiti 9 months ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't know that Oswald and De Mohrenschildt corresponded
after De Mohrenschildt left for Haiti?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you think of any other matter about which you might
have knowledge, or anything else that you can think of that you think should
be brought to the attention of the Commission in connection with this matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. I would only add that in my opinion, George is an extremely
discerning person, and while right now his emotions are kind of tensed up, not
because of politics, but because of his personal life and finances and things
concerning prior marriages and his children, and consequently his behavior
and conduct right now might not be the best, but despite that, he is an extremely
intelligent and fine person and I would think that he should be in a position
to contribute as much as anyone on the type of person that Lee Harvey Oswald
was.</p>

<p>George was speaking the language. There was a rapport. They were both
familiar with the same geography, and George and his wife were befriending
him. I would think George could give a pretty good personality sketch and
political sketch on Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any reason to believe that there is any truth in
the remark that De Mohrenschildt was alleged to have made concerning
the FBI's involvement in the assassination and Oswald's being a patsy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. Do I have any reason to believe that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No, sir; I have no reason to believe that. I would only add
that if there is one faint line of skepticism still in my mind about Lee Harvey
Oswald, and if I were to draw up alternative possibilities using my wildest
imagination and draw up a list of 10,000 other possibilities, I suppose included
in that 10,000 might be some unofficial cabal of the FBI, but the answer to your
question is "No."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Rags or Chris indicate to you whether or not either of
the De Mohrenschildts had stated any reason for their belief that the FBI
was involved?</p>

<p>Let me ask you preliminarily, did Rags or Chris indicate that De Mohrenschildt
really believed that fact that he was alleged to have uttered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. They indicated that in De Mohrenschildt's emotional state,
that apparently this was a sentiment they arrived at.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now let's go back to the preceding question. Were there any
reasons expressed by De Mohrenschildt for this belief?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No; because Rags and Chris said this is a madness. That there
are no reasons, and this is a madness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Had De Mohrenschildt expressed any reason as to why he
believed this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. None were expressed to me; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you think of anything else that you want to add?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ballen</span>. No; I don't believe so.</p>

<h2 id="mld">TESTIMONY OF MRS. LYDIA DYMITRUK</h2>

<p>The testimony of Mrs. Lydia Dymitruk was taken on March 25, 1964, in the
office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Albert E. Jenner, Jr., assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am Albert Jenner.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dymitruk, will you stand to be sworn, please?</p>

<p>I am about to take your testimony by deposition. Do you solemnly swear
that you will tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help
you God?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you. Be seated please.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dymitruk, I am Albert E. Jenner, Jr. I am a member of the staff counsel
and consultant for and to the Commission appointed by the President of the
United States to investigate the assassination of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Now this is a Commission appointed pursuant to Executive Order of the
President of the United States, Mr. Lyndon B. Johnson, No. 11130, dated November
29, 1963, and Joint Resolution of the Congress of the United States
No. 137.</p>

<p>Have you received a letter from J. Lee Rankin, the general counsel for the
Commission, asking if you would come here and depose or have your deposition
taken?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And included with that letter were copies of the Executive order
and the resolution to which I have made reference?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, pursuant to that request, as a lot of other fine American
citizens, you are appearing voluntarily here this morning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As it appears from the Executive order and the resolution, the
Commission is investigating all the circumstances we can obtain respecting and
relating to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and also the subsequent
death of Lee Oswald, and persons involved in those two unfortunate
events. And it is our information that you have some possible information that
might help us with respect to Marina Oswald and Lee Oswald, and I should like
to question you about that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes, sir; I am ready.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You seem a little excited. Why don't you sit back and relax,
pull your chair around and be comfortable. Nothing's going to happen to you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. I'm not afraid.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your name is Lydia Dymitruk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And do I correctly pronounce your name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes, sir; that's all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it is spelled [spelling] L-y-d-i-a. And Dymitruk is [spelling]
D-y-m-i-t-r-u-k?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You live at 3542½ 10th Street in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And I'm not going to ask you if Fort Worth is a suburb of Dallas&mdash;because
I understand that would offend you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes, sir [laughter].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But it is a large Texas city about, what&mdash;25 or 30 miles from here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes, sir; I like it very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, it's a splendid town. You're employed at the Neiman-Marcus
store in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I understand that's a beautiful store.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. It is&mdash;it is beautiful store and nice place to work&mdash;and I like it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long have you resided in Fort Worth?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. How long I'm in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Let me see&mdash;I think it was from August.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of what year?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Last year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1962?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. 1962&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. And where have you resided prior to August 1962?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where? You came to Fort Worth in August 1962, did you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yeah; yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. From Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had been a resident of Dallas up to that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long had you been a resident of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Oh, about 4 years&mdash;and 3, 4 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And from where had you come when you came to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. From Belgium&mdash;Brussels.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you a native of Belgium?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes, sir; I am a citizen of Belgium.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are a <span class="locked">citizen&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Born in Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I might occasionally have to ask what might be considered personal
questions but I'm not merely curious&mdash;I'm seeking information.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. That's okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is your age?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Thirty-seven.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thirty-seven.</p>

<p>Are you married?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you ever been married?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In this country or in Belgium or in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. I was married in Belgium.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Married in Belgium?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your husband come with you to this country?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. He came first to United States, and I came afterward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Tell me how and the circumstances of your coming from Russia, where you
were born, to Belgium.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. In 1942, we were kidnapped from the Germans during the war
and brought to Germany&mdash;Dusseldorf.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was this your parents and you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. No; just sister&mdash;an older sister and I and that's all. We are
separated from the family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the German Army took you to Dusseldorf?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And then you were freed by the advancing Allied armies,
essentially?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. The Americans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The Americans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>And you and your sister went to Belgium, did you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes; 1945. After the war.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, my arithmetic is very bad. How old were you then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. In 1945?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Oh, 17.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. So you were about 15 years old when you were captured
by the Germans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where did you live in Russia when you were captured by the
Germans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Rostov.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. [Spelling] R-o-s-t-o-v?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or is that "o-w"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. No; it's "v".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any brothers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just yourself and your sister were the only children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. And a little sister&mdash;she was born after the war, in 1947.
So, I haven't seen her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your parents are still in Russia as far as you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. They are; yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were either of your parents active politically in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Active politically?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; was your father an active member of the Communist
Party, for example?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is your husband still in this country?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. We were divorced for, I think, 3 years ago&mdash;3½ years ago.
I don't know where he is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it for part of this time at least&mdash;was he an American?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. No; he was from White Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. White Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were married in Belgium, were you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he preceded you to this country?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he settle here in the Dallas area?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes; he settled for awhile. And&mdash;uh&mdash;he never settled down
in same place. He always traveled all over United States to find a better place
to live. But I like here, and I stay here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was his business or occupation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. His occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. He was a draftsman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Is he now an American citizen?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. I heard yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. And you certainly are?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Not yet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, you're not yet?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What status are you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is your status? Have you applied?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. I applied 5 years ago when I came to this country that I
would like to be American citizen. I can read, I can speak, but I can't write.
So that's why I have to go to school first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, to write English?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes. To have examinations you have to learn writing English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. But you are doing that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Oh, yes; I study at home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. And the Constitution of the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, yes; great document!</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes; I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were any children born of your marriage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. No children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know a lady by the name of Anna Meller?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Sometimes pronounced "Miller"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me your acquaintance with Anna Meller. How did it come
about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. When I came to United <span class="locked">States&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Wait a minute. What year was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. I think it was 1960.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. You came to the United States and you came to
Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You joined your husband here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you became acquainted with Anna Meller?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Not through him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Through George Bouhe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. George Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I met him the other day. Monday, as a matter of&mdash;what is
today? Yes, Monday.</p>

<p>George Bouhe&mdash;he's a resident here in Dallas, a man who takes a great
interest in all Russian emigre people, and he tried to organize a little church,
did he not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Well, he helps everybody I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. He's a short, bald-headed man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes. He's not just to help Russian people, he helps everybody&mdash;Germans,
Belgians, everybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He's a generous man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. He just like to help. That's <span class="locked">all&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He's bouncy and vigorous. All right. I interrupted you. Go
ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. That's okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your acquaintance with Anna Meller?</p>

<p>Mrs <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes; I met her at George's <span class="locked">house&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You met her where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. At George Bouhe's house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. And, since then, once in while I see her in church or I
go visit her at home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. What church is that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. It's the Russian church.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Russian Orthodox Church?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Russian Orthodox Church. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall the name of it? Saint somebody or other?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. I don't know the name because I go to both churches. One is
Father Dimitri's church on Newton Avenue. I went there and few times I
went to George Bouhe&mdash;but I don't know the name. I don't know if it's his
name or not. I don't know; really. That's his church and he just likes everybody
to go there&mdash;but I prefer to go to this one&mdash;Father Dimitri's church.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. So, once in while, I see Anna Meller at a party somewhere
or when I'm in Dallas, I visit with her and her husband.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In their home?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In 1962, you were living in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. 1962; yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had an apartment of your own at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And where was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. It was on McKinney Avenue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. McKinney?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. McKinney Avenue. Yes. Palm Gardens Apartments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was there an occasion when there was an interchange
between you and Mrs. Meller with respect to the possibility of your befriending
or harboring another lady&mdash;taking somebody into your home&mdash;your apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any conversation at any time between you and Mrs.
Meller about the possibility of your taking a lady into your home temporarily?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Well, I couldn't take in my home because I got just one
little room. I couldn't take. But it was once a conversation&mdash;I remember it&mdash;that
Marina Oswald, she was looking to live with somebody in a house, or not
to be by herself, because she was separated from her husband.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Separated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes. It was some kind of conversation that I ought to
help her, or something, but I didn't know her in that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you heard of her at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. I heard about her, yes; but I haven't met her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From whom?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. It was from Anna Meller. Anna Meller and George Bouhe.
Both of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Told you <span class="locked">about&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. About, yes. That she's separated from her husband and she
are looking for&mdash;uh&mdash;to help&mdash;for somebody can help her to find a living or
somewhere. But she was at that time somewhere living with somebody, but
I don't know with whom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. Did George Bouhe or Mrs. Meller then tell you about
this lady?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Oh, yes; she told me&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did she&mdash;what did they tell you about her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. I visit her on Sunday once and&mdash;uh&mdash;she told me that
Marina was in her apartment for a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had lived with Mrs. Meller a week?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. With Mrs. Meller; Yes. And that she went back to her
husband and that she called, that was on Sunday, and she cried that her baby
is very ill and the husband he won't go to the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The husband would not take them to the hospital?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. The baby to the hospital or to see a doctor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. And she asked <span class="locked">me&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, Mrs. Meller asked you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Mrs. Meller; yes. She asked me if I want to go and see
her and take that baby to the hospital or to the doctor because I've got my
own transportation. And I told her on Sunday, I don't want to go. So&mdash;and
I thought about it on Monday and I think, "Well, I don't know. If something
happened to that baby, then it's my fault. I better go." So, on Tuesday was
my day off and so Anna Meller she give me the address and she says, "If you
can go&mdash;if you go to her and see her, could you bring the books?" They borrowed
a dictionary&mdash;English dictionary&mdash;hers and George Bouhe's&mdash;dictionaries. I
said, "Well, okay."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. Mrs. Meller asked you that if you went to the
Oswalds, would you please bring with <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. English-language and Russian-language <span class="locked">dictionaries&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Well, they were English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. English dictionaries that the Mellers had; that you would then
bring <span class="locked">them&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. To her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To Mrs. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. No. Those books were at Marina's house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. There was two books. One, George gave it to her; and
other one, Anna Meller gave it to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And they were both English-language dictionaries?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes; English-Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. English-Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>So, she asked me to bring it back&mdash;those books.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. So, it was on Tuesday early in the <span class="locked">morning&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tuesday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Tuesday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I thought you said Thursday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. No; Tuesday is my day off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. And on Tuesday I went to Marina's house&mdash;I found her
house&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was she at home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. At first, I couldn't find her at all. I went, first, to see the
landlady, and I talked to her for a minute&mdash;maybe 5 or 10 minutes&mdash;and I ask her
where she lives, in which apartment. There was so many apartments&mdash;some
empty&mdash;and, you know, I just couldn't find her. So, she showed me where to
go up to find her. So, I came there, I knocked on door and she came. And I
asked her if she was Marina Oswald and she said, "Yes."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that the first time you ever met Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. That's the first time. I think was the first time. The first
I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. She said, "well, yes?"</p>

<p>And I said to her, "I hear that your baby is sick. Anna Meller told me that
your baby's very sick and you need help. And maybe I can help you to bring
that baby to the hospital."</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, "my husband, he's against it and I'm in trouble with him.
I don't know what to do."</p>

<p>And I said, "Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Well, he's working."</p>

<p>I said, "Well, so long as he's working, we can go to the hospital." I said,
"Do you have a doctor of your own?"</p>

<p>She said, "Well, I don't know. It was some kind of doctor before, but I don't
know."</p>

<p>I said, "Well, okay. Let's go to the hospital."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you speaking in Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, I take it, you have a fluent command of the Russian language&mdash;you
speak Russian well?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And do you have an impression as to Marina? Did she speak
Russian well?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. So&mdash;and she said that the baby had <span class="locked">103&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Fever?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Fever. And I said&mdash;it was some kind of cold weather&mdash;"You
had better put some warm clothes&mdash;and in the car it's warm, so we go
to the hospital so they see that baby."</p>

<p>She said, "Well, all right."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
So, it was about 10 o'clock or <span class="locked">10:30&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the morning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. In the morning.</p>

<p>I went to the Parkland Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, we'll just hesitate a minute.</p>

<p>Did you enter the apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And tell us what you observed as to the conditions around the
apartment. How she was dressed; whether you thought they might or did
have funds, or whether they were poor; what did she look like? You know.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Uh&mdash;I think she was all right. And house was clean. And
it was, I mean, it was nice apartment. I lived in much worse apartment when
I came to United States&mdash;so&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So, she was neat, the apartment was neat and <span class="locked">clean&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she was neat and clean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, I take it, you had, at that moment, a good impression of
her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what sex was this baby&mdash;girl or boy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. It was a girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A little girl. About how old?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. (Gesturing with hands.) Baby couldn't walk. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could not walk? All right. That's really what I was getting at.
She was carrying the baby in her arms?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could you recall a little more clearly what she said about her
husband? That is, was she having difficulty with him or were they getting
along well&mdash;or what was your impression in that respect?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Well, I haven't seen him at all&mdash;so, I couldn't say <span class="locked">anything&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I know, but from what she said, Mrs. Dymitruk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Oh, that's what she said about her husband&mdash;that he's
against the hospital and against the doctors because he can't afford to pay
the bills.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. So, I said to her at the Parkland Hospital you don't have
to pay anything or maybe something&mdash;I don't know.</p>

<p>So, I took her to the hospital with her baby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You went to the Parkland Hospital here in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you drove Marina and her child?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. So, we come to the hospital emergency room, they checked
the baby, fever 103, they give some little medicine for the temperature to go
down, and they said, "I'm sorry, we can't help you; we don't have a children's
doctor here."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do not have a children's doctor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. No; I was little bit surprised because they deliver babies
over there every day so many and they don't have a children's doctor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. And I said, "Well, what we can do right now? I don't
know what to do with the baby now."</p>

<p>"Well, if you can come in the evening."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The doctor or the attendant <span class="locked">said&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. That was the nurse.</p>

<p>And she said, "Well, in the evening, it will be a doctor for the children."</p>

<p>I said, "Is it possible to find somebody else right now?"</p>

<p>Because the baby couldn't breathe and I don't know&mdash;I don't have my own
children but really I was scared to see baby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. And they said, "Well, we give the address to go to another
children's hospital in Dallas."</p>

<p>And that's what I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You and Marina and the baby then drove <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember where that was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Sir, I don't remember. It was a little hospital&mdash;children's
hospital. I think it was free. You don't have to pay anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, yes; it was a clinic-type of hospital?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Just for children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. So, when I come there there were at least 40 children there
waiting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 40?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. I think so. There were so many children.</p>

<p>And at first I asked the nurse to take care of the baby if it is possible right
away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Because the baby has a fever?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes; and she said, "Well, I'm sorry. I can't help it."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Cannot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. "I cannot&mdash;because they have so many children here and
you have to wait your turn."</p>

<p>I said, "Maybe those children&mdash;&mdash;"&mdash;I see around there&mdash;playing around&mdash;so,
I say, "Maybe they don't have a fever high like this. Can't you take baby right
away?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; you have to wait 3 or 4 hours"&mdash;or something like that.</p>

<p>I said, "Well, I'm sorry. We have to go home."</p>

<p>So, I brought her home. It was about 2 o'clock. And I said to her, "Well,
if your husband comes home, you have to decide what to do. If you want it,
I can take you to hospital this evening."</p>

<p>She said, "Yes."</p>

<p>So I came to see her around, maybe 6 o'clock&mdash;maybe 5 o'clock or something&mdash;I
don't remember. But when I came home to see her her husband wasn't home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Was not. I said, "Now, Marina, I would like to take you
to the hospital. Do you want to go?"</p>

<p>She said, "Yes; but wait just a minute when my husband will be back."</p>

<p>I said, "Okay."</p>

<p>So he came home and first he was <span class="locked">eating&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you introduced to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes. She said, "That's my husband." And he spoke Russian
to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He did speak Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes; and I was really surprised&mdash;in short time, he spoke
nicely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He spoke pretty good Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>So&mdash;and I asked him if he wanted to go to the hospital with the baby. And
he said, "I don't know. I can't afford it. I can't pay."</p>

<p>So they went to the living room and I was sitting in the kitchen, and they
were fighting in the living room&mdash;what to do&mdash;to go or not to go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it a real argument?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. It was. Yes. I could hear from the kitchen that they
argued.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was a heated argument?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Well, they were just&mdash;uh&mdash;I don't know what it was all
about, but when they came out they told me that they wanted to go to the
hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. And from what you heard of this argument, he didn't want
to go, she did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. She want to go but <span class="locked">he&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He did not want to go?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. No; no. So then he decide that he want to go to the hospital
and take his baby. I said, "All right."</p>

<p>So, we went to the hospital and we found a doctor. And there were children
waiting and we wait. So he took care of the baby. He&mdash;the doctor took a blood
test and took a X-ray&mdash;a lung X-ray and, I don't know, all kind of tests, right
away.</p>

<p>So, on the way back&mdash;he got some kind of papers, I think it was two copies or
three copies of <span class="locked">papers&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From the hospital?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. From the doctor to go to the service desk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. So, at the service desk&mdash;he was standing here [indicating],
I was behind him, and Marina was behind me with the baby. So&mdash;and the
service desk asked question&mdash;the address and if he's working, and he said "No."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Not working?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. No. Then she said, "Do you have unemployment&mdash;do you
get some unemployment money?"</p>

<p>He said, "No."</p>

<p>And she said, "Well, how do you live then?"</p>

<p>He said, "Well, friends helping me."</p>

<p>And Marina&mdash;she was behind me&mdash;and she says, "What a liar!"</p>

<p>And they argue again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They argued&mdash;between the two of them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes, in Russian language.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he overhear her make the remark to you that you've just
told us?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. That's what she told. That's what she told.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he hear her say that&mdash;is what <span class="locked">I'm&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes&mdash;because then they were in argument.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then, they got in an argument?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what was the argument about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Well, about the&mdash;that he is not working&mdash;because he was
lying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. Did he say why he lied?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. No; no. He didn't say anything.</p>

<p>So, that piece of paper&mdash;he received some kind of <span class="locked">paper&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. To turn around and to pay a cashier, or something, I think
so&mdash;but he put it in his pocket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He put the paper in his pocket?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. In his pocket.</p>

<p>And so we came out and I brought them home&mdash;and I didn't come into the
house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They just got out of the car and went in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes. They didn't say anything&mdash;thank you or what&mdash;anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They just got out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yeah. You know, one thing, he said, "I don't want to pay
any penny. It's suppose to be free. Doctors and everything in Russia is free.
It's suppose to be free here, too."</p>

<p>I didn't like that at all. I was disgusted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were <span class="locked">disgusted&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. I was disgusted with him <span class="locked">[laughing]&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall that the burden of his argument, the point of his
argument was that these things were free in <span class="locked">Russia&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. That's right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And they should be free in the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he shouldn't be required to pay? If they were free, he
shouldn't be paying?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes; that's what he figures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When, if ever, did you next see either Marina or Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. I have seen her. It was in 1963, summertime&mdash;I think was
in July or June, or something like that. I saw her in Irving. I worked in Irving
as manager of a French bakery in the Wyatt's Store&mdash;located in Wyatt's Store
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's a supermarket?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes. And I managed the bakery.</p>

<p>So, I saw her <span class="locked">shopping&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. I assume you speak French, too, do you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Very little.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Very little?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes. Flemish and German.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Flemish and German and Russian&mdash;and English?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. And English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You do very well with English.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Thank you. And I saw her with little baby and her dressed
maternity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So she had the same child she had the year before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she was pregnant with another child?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Well, she was dressed like she was.</p>

<p>And I just saw her from far&mdash;and I said, "Marina?"</p>

<p>"Oh!" she says, "How are you?"</p>

<p>I said, "Okay."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she recognize you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Oh, yes. And she said, "Do you see anything on me?"</p>

<p>I said, "Well, I don't know."</p>

<p>She said, "Well, I expect another baby."</p>

<p>I said, "Well," I said, "that's something." I said, "How is your husband
doing?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he's in New Orleans. And I'm going to New Orleans, too."</p>

<p>And there was another lady with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There was another lady? Would you describe the other lady,
please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Well, she was tall, black hair. She spoke Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was her command of Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Very&mdash;not too bad. But I was surprised at her. Because
I thought she was English first&mdash;her type of face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. And she said, "Well, no. I'm American&mdash;and I went to the
university and studied Russian&mdash;and I practice now with Marina."</p>

<p>I said, "Why Russian?" I said, "Well, in United States, if you need another
language, you study Spanish or French or German. Why Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. "Oh," she said, "I don't know, but I like very much the Russian
language.</p>

<p>And I thought [gesturing with hands out, palms up]&mdash;I don't know.</p>

<p>And they sit down on the table and I give them some coffee. And she say
that the lady was with her, she will drive her to New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The lady who was accompanying Marina was going to drive
Marina to New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What time of the year was this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Years and dates, I'm just lost.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, was it in the spring?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. No, no, no. It was in summertime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was in the summertime?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. In summertime. Just before we close up the store. I think
was in July, or maybe June. I'm not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. That's the last time I saw her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's the last time you saw Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is that the last time you had even any indirect contact&mdash;people
speaking of her&mdash;that is, prior to November 22&mdash;did you hear about
her in between?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Not at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you were assisting them with their child and went to
their apartment, that apartment was here in Dallas, was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes; I think it was in Oak Cliff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In Oak Cliff?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. I think was in Oak Cliff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In your driving to the clinic that evening with Lee Oswald and
Marina and the baby and your returning home that night, was there any discussion
at any time, other than you have already indicated, of his views with
respect to Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. It was just only about the hospitalization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Only the hospitalization?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes, sir; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you learn, during the course of those visits with Marina
and the visit to the hospital with both of them, as to whether he had been in
Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. I knew; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You knew that before&mdash;well, I'll ask you this: How did you
know he had been to Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. I knew from George Bouhe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From George Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes; he told me about it&mdash;uh&mdash;one person who went to
Russia and then he come back with Russian wife and a baby&mdash;back to United
States. "Well," I say, "that's one thing&mdash;that he learned something. To go
to Russia and he didn't like it and then he come back. He was just lucky that
he did come back to United States."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was fortunate that he could come back?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In your talks with Marina that morning, when you were taking
her to the hospital and you brought her back, you were with her a good many
hours?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Oh&mdash;let me see. It was maybe till 2 o'clock&mdash;2:30 maybe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she say anything about the circumstances of her meeting
Oswald in Russia? Did she tell you anything about her life or their lives
in Russia and their life here in the United States? Did you girls have some
smalltalk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. It was just about life in United States; not in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Not in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. No.</p>

<p>She told me that her husband want to go back to Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, she did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. "And I don't want to go," she say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Fine. Tell me about that. Was it, to the best of your recollection,
that her husband wanted to go back to Russia, including himself and her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or was it that he wanted her to go back to Russia and he was
going to stay here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. No; he wanted to go with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. And she said, "He can go if he want to, but I don't go&mdash;because
I like here and I don't go."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. But she did make a point of telling you about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, can you recall anything else that occurred during this day
when you were with them for a good many hours?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. No; with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes&mdash;with her.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Well, I asked her if she like United States. She says,
"United States, I do&mdash;but not everything"</p>

<p>I said, "What you mean&mdash;not everything?"</p>

<p>"Well, just the same problem&mdash;the hospitalization and the doctors."</p>

<p>I said to her that in United States we have, when you work with a company,
you have insurance. You pay just a little every month and then if you go
to the hospital, the insurance company will pay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. That's how I explain to her.</p>

<p>"Well, in Russia, when a baby is born in Russia&mdash;my baby was born in
Russia, and they took care and when I come home from the hospital there was
a nurse for 8 days in my room who took care of the baby&mdash;and why is it not
in United States like this?"</p>

<p>I said to her, "Well, you just can't compare two countries&mdash;Russia and
United States." I said, "I am longer here and I can explain so you will
understand."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you explain to her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. I explained about this hospitalization what we have here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. "Well," she said, "it's still too expensive. If you have to
go doctor, you pay the visit."</p>

<p>I said, "You can go to the hospital&mdash;to the Parkland Hospital and it cost you
nothing because they don't charge you anything."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. "If you have your own doctor, for example, if you go to
doctor, then you pay $10 or $5 or something like that." I said, "Why, that's
nothing."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't afford it."</p>

<p>I said, "Well, that's why I'm taking you to hospital&mdash;to Parkland Hospital&mdash;to
see the doctor and you don't have to pay anything."</p>

<p>That was the only&mdash;what she complained about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But otherwise she thought well of the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. She liked it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She wanted to stay?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. She want to stay; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In any event, she did not want to go back to Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But she told you that her husband did want to return to Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember specifically now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes; I remember. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have a firm recollection that it was that he wanted to
go back with her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. With her. And she said, "I don't want to go. If he want
to go, he can go by himself. I stay here."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, did she say anything, during the course of this time you
were with her, about her husband's attitude toward the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. She told me that he was unhappy and that he was very
disappointed; that he would lose jobs just because that he was in Russia and
the people find out that he was in Russia, so he's on the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. And that's why he was always so upset.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. All right.</p>

<p>Now, Mrs. Dymitruk, does anything occur to you now to which you would
like to call my attention and, through me, the Commission, that you think for
any possible reason might be helpful to us in this important investigation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Well, in my opinion, naturally, everyone American who goes
from United States to Russia, let them there. Don't bring them back. That's
the only thing that I can say. It's no reason to leave United States and change
your nationality or something. Because I have experience myself. I lived in
Russia for 15 years and, in my childhood, I knew too much about the life in
Russia. And I can't see any reason that American want to go to Russia and
to accept Russian life&mdash;I mean the Communists. I can't see that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have a personal aversion to communism?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it's your viewpoint that if any American goes to Russia
with the intention of living there that we ought to leave them there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And not encourage him to return to the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Not encourage&mdash;or if he ask to come back, just let him
stay there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh. All right.</p>

<p>Anything else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Let's see&mdash;Uh&mdash;one thing that I'm just always wonder about
Marina and her husband&mdash;that she knew&mdash;if she knew that her husband tried
to kill General Walker. I think she was responsible, in that case, to tell the
Government or somebody in Government that her husband tried to do this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It's your viewpoint <span class="locked">about&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes, sir; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That she should have disclosed that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes, sir. Husband or no husband, I would feel that I should.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your feeling is that regardless of whether it was a husband, or
whomever it might have <span class="locked">been&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was involved in such an incident, that it should have been
disclosed to the police or the Government?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Well, you ask questions. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I can't think of anything at the moment.</p>

<p>Now, we've had occasional discussions off the record when the reporter hasn't
been transcribing. Is there anything that occurred during the course of any off-the-record
discussion that I haven't brought out in questioning you that you
think is pertinent here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Everything that's pertinent I have questioned you about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As far as you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, Mrs. Dymitruk, this questioning will be transcribed and this fine young
lady will have it some time next week. You may read it if you desire, or not&mdash;as
you see fit. And some people like to read it over and see if they're any corrections
they would like to make. That's optional. You may or may not as
you see fit. And you have a right to do this if you want. You also may
waive it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. I think that's all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You would prefer to waive it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. I think that's all right. What I say is truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, all right.</p>

<p>Thank you very much. We appreciate your coming voluntarily. It's certainly
an inconvenience, I know, but you've been very helpful.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dymitruk</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your profession or avocation or vocation or work bring you

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Give me your occupations back through, let us say, 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Uh&mdash;prior to joining the Sellers Co. in September last, I was
self-employed in the Motion Picture Industry in Dallas as a grip and assistant
cameraman. Before that, I worked at various part-time jobs and attended
college at Arlington State.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you a graduate of Arlington State?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No; I'm not. I'm a 3-year student.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So, you've had elementary and high school education and 3 years
at Arlington State?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you attending there at night&mdash;is that a night school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. They hold night classes. I'm not attending.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During the time you had your interest, which you still may have,
in&mdash;what did you say&mdash;photographing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the nature of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Oh&mdash;it was motion picture work primarily centered around television
commercials.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you an amateur camera fan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Just a little bit. I try to carry it on as best I can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you at any time become acquainted with or meet either
Marina or Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which of the two did you meet first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I don't actually remember. I met both of them on the same day
in their home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the same occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you had any information about them prior to the time you
met them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; I had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, when was it you met them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I believe it was in September 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was this a prearranged meeting, an accidental meeting, or was
it a purposeful meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was prearranged.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Prearranged. All right. We'll get to the purpose in a moment,
if we can defer that for a bit.</p>

<p>Would you tell us the circumstances, persons involved also, that led to your
becoming acquainted in advance with something about the Oswalds and which
led up to the occasion when you met them, as you have now indicated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. All right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In other words, how did it come about&mdash;from the beginning of
the world to the present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Uh&mdash;about a week before I met them, uh&mdash;my wife was told
of them by either her father or stepmother. That would be either Mr. or Mrs.
George De Mohrenschildt [spelling] D-e M-o-h-r-e-n-s-c-h-i-l-d-t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. And the first name is George. And do you know the present
Mrs. De Mohrenschildt's first name&mdash;given name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. It is pronounced Zhon [phonetic].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Pronounced as though it's spelled J-o-n?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes&mdash;uh&mdash;it is pronounced as the Dutch would say it&mdash;Zhon. I
believe that she uses the French spelling of the name, although I'm not familiar
with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is she sometimes called Jeanne [spelling] J-e-a-n-n-e?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes. I'm not sure of the "e" on the end of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I'd like to back up a moment. Your wife&mdash;what was her maiden
name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Alexandra <span class="locked">Romyne&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. [Spelling] R-o-m-i-n-e?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. [Spelling] R-o-m-y-n-e.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she was the daughter of whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Of George De Mohrenschildt and a woman who is now known
as Mrs. J.&nbsp;M. Brandel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Spell that last name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. [Spelling] B-r-a-n-d-e-l.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the present Mrs. Brandel&mdash;she was the wife of George
De Mohrenschildt and, in turn, is the mother of your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That is true. But that is not the present Mrs. De Mohrenschildt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No. I appreciate that. Where does she live now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Mrs. Brandel, as last I knew, was living at Stellara B.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Will you spell that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. [Spelling] S-t-e-l-l-a-r-a B.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just the letter B?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Just the letter B. I believe Stellara means apartment in
Italian. Vagna Clara [spelling] V-a-g-n-a C-l-a-r-a, Rome, Italy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Has she remarried?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes, she has remarried&mdash;and her name is Brandel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How many children were born of that marriage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. One.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was the present Mrs. Brandel the first wife, second wife,
third wife of Mr. George De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. The first wife&mdash;to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you informed that in addition to the present Mrs. Brandel
and the present Mrs. De Mohrenschildt, De Mohrenschildt also was married to
at least one, if not two other women?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes, I am aware of one other one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Will you tell us about the one that you do have in mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I know very little about her, other than that her name is Dee&mdash;her
first name is Dee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. [Spelling] D-e-e?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Dee or DeeDee? Is she sometimes called DeeDee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. She may have been. And that they had two children, one of which
is deceased.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the one who still survives is male or female?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Female.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know her name and whereabouts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Her given name is Nodjia&mdash;and I do not know the spelling of it.
It is, I believe, a Russian name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could you spell it phonetically?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. [Spelling] N-o-d-j-i-a (phonetic).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is she married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No. She's a minor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She's still a minor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where does she live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I believe in Philadelphia&mdash;but I can't be sure of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The impression is, at least, that she is living with her mother in
Philadelphia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Rather than with the De Mohrenschildts in Port-au-Prince,
Haiti?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are aware of the fact that George De Mohrenschildt and his
present wife now, are at least presently, are residing in Port-au-Prince, Haiti?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>(Off the record discussion follows.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In order that the record be not too confused, I think it would be
well that you finish recounting what led up to your meeting with Marina and
Lee Harvey Oswald, and then I will go back when we finish that subject, and put
the De Mohrenschildts in proper perspective.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We have been off the record in the meantime, haven't we, Mr.
Taylor, during which time you recounted to me something about the De Mohrenschildts
and the relation between your present wife and the De Mohrenschildts,
and other matters in that connection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We will bring that out later.</p>

<p>(At this point, Mr. Jenner asked your reporter to orient the witness by referring
back to the point of interruption, when he started recounting how his meeting
with the Oswalds came about.)</p>

<p>Your <span class="smcap">Reporter</span>. [Reading] "About a week before I met them, my wife was
told of them by either her father or stepmother&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. George De
Mohrenschildt."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, that's where I interrupted. Please go on from there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. They explained to us <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you say "they," you mean whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. One or the other of the De Mohrenschildts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Explained to my <span class="locked">wife&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is something your wife told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That a Russian girl, Mrs. Oswald, was living in Fort Worth
with her husband, and that they were going to be&mdash;the De Mohrenschildts were
going to be in Fort Worth on Sunday afternoon attending a concert and that
after the concert, they would like for us to join them, the De Mohrenschildts,
and visit the Oswalds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, when was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. In early September of 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Go on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. <span class="locked">We&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. Had you ever heard of a Lee Oswald or of an American
being back here with a Russian wife&mdash;or was this entirely new to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. This was new to me. I was not aware of the presence of either
one of them prior to this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, as far as you know, was it new to your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, from a conversation we had while we were off the record,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
the wife you now speak of&mdash;that is, back in 1962&mdash;that is not your present wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But that wife&mdash;what was her maiden name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Alexandra Romyne De Mohrenschildt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. And we met them, as they had suggested, in Fort Worth one
Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you say "them," you <span class="locked">mean&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. The two De Mohrenschildts. And we met the Oswalds and
<span class="locked">also&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. What did you do? You went to the concert over
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. We went to the Oswalds' home. We had been given an address
and a time when the De Mohrenschildts would already have arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And when you arrived at this place, were your father-in-law
and mother-in-law present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And where was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. This was on Mercedes Street. I do not remember the number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes, sir; in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You located the apartment, as you had been advised of the
number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; it was a house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was a house&mdash;not an apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. It was a house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it a single-family dwelling or a duplex?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I'm not sure. It was either a single-family unit or a duplex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have no present recollection which one it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No, sir; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Describe to us what you saw in the way of the room or rooms,
the surroundings, whether neat and clean and whether threadbare or new
furniture&mdash;or what did it look like inside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. It was a comparatively bare room, as I remember, uncarpeted.
The furniture was badly worn. It was, however, clean&mdash;particularly so considering
the number of people that were there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it was orderly&mdash;not messy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, when you entered that room, there were present two
persons introduced to you as Mr. and Mrs. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was Mrs. Oswald introduced to you as Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I believe she was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your father-in-law and your mother-in-law, the De Mohrenschildts,
yourself, and your wife&mdash;anybody else present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; several other people were present. Lee Oswald's mother
was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Marguerite Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes. George Bouhe was there. A Mr. and Mrs. Hall was there&mdash;John
Hall and his estranged wife. I'm not sure of her name&mdash;first name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Elena [spelling] E-l-e-n-a Hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Elena.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which, of any, of these people had you known prior to the
time that you stepped into this room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Only the De Mohrenschildts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So, this was your first acquaintance with the Halls, your first
acquaintance with Marguerite Oswald, and your first acquaintance with Lee
and Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what ensued&mdash;by way of what anybody did and what anybody
said?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I don't remember but very sketchily what went on that afternoon.
There's a number of questions in my mind about what preceded&mdash;I mean, Mrs.
<span class="locked">Oswald&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Will you please state them and where you are stating a question
in your mind as distinct from something that was <span class="locked">said&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Well, I will come to that. I was only trying to establish a general
vagueness of recollection of the afternoon. Mrs. Oswald left shortly after
I arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you mean Marguerite?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; Lee's mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you ever seen her other than on this short visit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Not except in news media. Never in person other than that one
afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you've had no contact with her directly since this particular
occasion you are now relating?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the news media to which you refer is news media activities
subsequent to November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was just there for about 5 minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Less than 45 minutes, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have an opportunity to form an impression of her in
those few minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I just have a vague recollection of a somewhat plump woman who
seemed to be&mdash;uh&mdash;out of place in the present crowd that was there that afternoon.
And she didn't seem to be particularly interested in anything that went
on&mdash;and I think that's what prompted her to leave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have an opportunity to observe and form an opinion from
those observations as to the attitude between Lee Oswald and Marguerite?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I would say that it was one of estrangement between them; that
they had very little communication between them; that they were almost
strangers&mdash;and possibly even didn't like each other. Particularly on Lee's part,
I should think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was your impression?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this was, again, September of 1962&mdash;did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. September 1962. Okay&mdash;I've got myself oriented.
Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. And that we talked generally about some of the things that&mdash;uh&mdash;some
of Lee's observations about Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he speak in English or Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. He spoke in English when talking to my wife of that time or I;
and quite often in Russian&mdash;as I believe everyone in the room spoke Russian except
my wife, myself, and John Hall. I'm not sure if John Hall spoke Russian
or not&mdash;but certainly both the De Mohrenschildts, and George Bouhe does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. George Bouhe, both of the De Mohrenschildts&mdash;your mother-in-law
and father-in-law and both the Oswalds&mdash;Lee and Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That's right. In addition to that, there was Mrs. Hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Mrs. Hall also spoke Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Neither you nor your then wife spoke Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. She had a knowledge of Russian but certainly not enough to
converse with them. She could understand some Russian when it was spoken
to her, but could not speak but just a few words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could she follow a normal conversation between two others who
were speaking so each could understand the other, but not any attempt to slow
down and what-not in order to enable her to try and pick up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I imagine they would have had to have spoken very plainly and
slowly and using simple words for her to have understood any of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I believe I interrupted you at a point where you stated that you
talked generally about some of Lee's experiences and observations about Russia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
Would you continue from that point, indicating as best you can now recall,
what was said about Lee's experiences in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. It's difficult to remark specifically about what we talked of that
day. Perhaps it would be better if I&mdash;uh&mdash;told you all I can remember that
he said about Russia on several occasions now rather than&mdash;because I cannot
remember specifically what we discussed on that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. So we can get one point in the record&mdash;I'll probably
ask more specifically about the different occasions later on. But give us a running
account such as you have indicated you desire to make.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. All right. Lee, on various occasions, and I discussed the life that
he led in Russia, his experiences in Russia, and his general observations about it.
I guess I should best start with his observations of family life there.</p>

<p>He and Marina lived in an apartment. It was about 10 x 14. And he
remarked that all families in Russia lived in apartments of this approximate size
regardless of the size of the families&mdash;that there were no private residences
as we think of them. And that six family units would be grouped around a
community kitchen and lavatory, and where all the families shared the same
facilities. And that he and Marina did live in this manner. That he worked as
a sheet-metal fabricator in the town of Minsk, and received for his remuneration
for his work 45 rubles a month&mdash;which was the minimum, he said, that everyone
in Russia receives whether they work or not.</p>

<p>He went into some detail about what is received directly from the State
without payment. In other words, what services a Russian citizen receives in
what we would call socialized services&mdash;such as medicine. A Russian citizen
does not have to pay for medical services; the house&mdash;apartment, a place to
live, a Russian citizen does not have to pay for it. There is no charge for this.
And we also discussed what other people made. I believe he said Marina
received 180 rubles a month for her work as a pharmacist. And that she had
received training in that. And we discussed their school system somewhat&mdash;how
a student that worked hard is allowed to continue with his schooling,
whereas a student that either doesn't work hard or isn't capable is taken only
to a level of which they are capable and then put to work.</p>

<p>And we went on and discussed their financial system a little bit further, and
I learned that a person does get raises in a job, that salaries&mdash;once you are
given a job, why your salary does increase as you continue through the years on
a skilled job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As your skills increase?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No; at the same job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. As your age increases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. In other words, for length of time at your machine, for example.
When you first come to work, like Lee, and you make 45 rubles a month, as he
does it for so many years or for such a length of time, he gets a raise over and
above that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then, that increase comes purely as a matter of passage of time
and has no relation to skill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say anything about&mdash;take the example he gave&mdash;machine
operator&mdash;if the machine operator next to Oswald, for example&mdash;take a hypothetical
person&mdash;is much more skillful then Oswald, is the compensation the
same?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Uh&mdash;to my knowledge, it would be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's the impression you received?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That is the impression I received. I believe he said that someone
doing his job, by the time they reach retirement age&mdash;I don't remember what
that was&mdash;would be receiving something just under 200 rubles a month for
performing the same task.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he indicate a comparative relationship between the ruble
and the dollar&mdash;to give you some notion of what 45 rubles a month, for example,
or 200 rubles a month meant in terms of American money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I asked Lee that question, as I remember, and he told me that
a comparison was difficult because of the socialized or free services given to
the citizen by the Government; that, for example, out of his 45 rubles a month<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
that he had to buy little other than food and clothing; and that the 45 rubles
a month would buy food, a bare minimum, and sufficient clothing to clothe one
individual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Liberally? Or just enough to get along?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Just enough to get going on&mdash;in both cases. And that his impression&mdash;the
impression he left with me was that a person needed little else
as far as entertainment and so on was concerned, these things were held by
the State so that&mdash;uh&mdash;to get the families out of these cramped quarters, that
everything&mdash;and constant entertainment in some form&mdash;athletics, or occasional
motion pictures, different kinds of stage presentations&mdash;were held nightly away
from the home, so that the families could get out of the cramped quarters and
wouldn't feel this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was all designed, in part at least, with that objective in
mind&mdash;of getting people out of their cramped quarters or room apartments,
into theatres and concert halls and athletic events?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That's right. And we discussed travel for the average Russian
citizen&mdash;which is nonexistent. A person <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you are telling us things he said to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; to the best of my memory I am telling you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To the best of your ability? You are not rationalizing or
speculating from things you have read in works published with respect to
life in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are trying to do your best to tell us what he said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. He said that for the average worker or citizen in Russia that
travel was nonexistent; that a person that grew up in Minsk would probably
spend his whole life without venturing far from the city. That living areas
like the apartment he lived in were built around factories so that a person in
a job like his, he wouldn't even probably know what was across on the other
side of the city. And this is just about the end, at least, to my easy recollection
of the things that we discussed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was anything said about the context of 180 rubles a month
earned by Marina and 45 rubles a month earned by Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I don't remember any specific comments that he made about
that. The only thing I remember in this regard was that he did mention at
one time that Marina had a higher education than he had and that&mdash;uh&mdash;I
don't believe I ever heard him say anything else about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In any event, you didn't raise the question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say that Marina, after they married, that Marina worked
as well as he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I don't remember whether she worked after they were married
or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say anything about custom and habit in Russia that
wives worked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; he mentioned that most wives&mdash;most women do work.
He didn't, as I remember, go into any specifics about it. I don't remember
much being said about it other than that most women do work&mdash;or, I should
say, they are encouraged to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he state or did he imply, do you have any impression on
his reaction toward this life in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. He&mdash;uh&mdash;oh, he indicated throughout our discussions that he
was dissatisfied with the life of the average Russian citizen; that they didn't
have any freedoms, as we think of freedom, in other words, to go get in our
car and go where we want to, do what we want to, or say what we want to; that,
generally speaking, they did not have this privilege as we enjoy it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say anything about any privileges or any activities on
his part that were different from&mdash;that is, that were accorded him&mdash;that were
different from those accorded Russian people or foreigners, let us say, in Russia,
having circumstances or work comparable to his? This is, was he treated or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
accorded benefits different from or in addition to those which would normally
have been accorded him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I think he felt like that the situation that the Russians put him
into&mdash;in other words, the environment they put him into&mdash;- was less than he
had anticipated. This is only an impression now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. It was never&mdash;we never discussed this. But I always felt
like that he was disappointed that they put him in a factory forming sheet
metal and didn't give him what he felt was something important to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is, did you have the impression, in your contacts with him
discussing his life in Russia, that he had an opinion of himself that was such
that he felt he was not being accorded that which at least his ambitions and
desires, he thought, warranted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I think that's true. He didn't&mdash;uh&mdash;I think he expected, as
a former American, to be treated as something special&mdash;as though he were
a rarity, because he had left this country and gone there, and that they would
have treated him with a red carpet, so to speak. Of course, he was very disappointed
what they actually gave him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your statement that he was very disappointed in what
he actually received&mdash;did he say that to you? Was it more than just an
impression on your part?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Uh&mdash;he never said that. It's only an impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it a distinct impression <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes. It's a very distinct impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That this is one of the reasons why I would never have asked
him, as you asked me, what he felt about his wife making more money. He
seemed very depressed about how the Russians had treated him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he appear to you to be sensitive on this score&mdash;that <span class="locked">he&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. It appeared that he would be sensitive if I had broached the
subject.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, have you exhausted your recollection as to what
he told you of his life in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say anything about any independent activity on his part&mdash;that
is, activity of his distinct from Marina&mdash;such as, for example, going
hunting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the subject of the use of firearms for hunting ever discussed
by him with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No; nor was the subject, which I think you were leading up to,
of the Russians' right or lack of right to own firearms discussed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The subject of firearms was never discussed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he discuss at any time with you, or did you hear him discuss
it in your presence, his effort to return to the United States and any difficulties,
if he had any, in that connection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; I believe he said that&mdash;uh&mdash;he did have difficulties and
that it took him&mdash;uh&mdash;about a year to get permission to come to this&mdash;return to
this country with his wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say anything about whether he undertook that effort
prior to his marriage&mdash;had commenced it prior to the time he had married
Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No; he indicated that he commenced it after his marriage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he discuss with you at any time, or was the subject discussed
in your presence, as to the courtship between Marina and himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No; or, if it was, I have no recollection of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he discuss with you, or was there a discussion in your
presence, of any illnesses on his part while he was in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Have we now exhausted his discussions with you
with respect to the subject of his life in Russia?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he discuss with you, or was there a discussion in your presence,
the subject of why he sought to return to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Oh, only that he was unhappy with both the way of life in Russia
and&mdash;uh&mdash;the place that he had been given in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he discuss with you, or was there a discussion in your
presence, the subject of Marina's inclinations in that connection&mdash;any desire
on her part to come to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No; there was never&mdash;uh&mdash;any discussion as to her feelings
about coming to this country at all. I don't think, in any case, that they were
important to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At least, they weren't discussed in your presence and not with
you directly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there discussed in your presence, or did he discuss directly
with you, their route back to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No; I believe the only thing that he ever mentioned about that
was that the American Embassy, I presume in Moscow, loaned him the money
to return.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he discuss with you, or was there discussed in your presence,
his reaction to the Russian system, as such, distinguished now from what was
accorded him which you have related&mdash;more in the area of the political area&mdash;the
Communist system, as such, the political philosophy, as distinguished from the
U.S.S.R. as a country or government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Well, everything that we discussed, of course&mdash;and the things
I have related&mdash;illustrate the distinction between the two political governments&mdash;such
as, services that a Russian citizen obtains free and the housing,
various rights or lack of them that the Russian citizen had. We did not discuss
the system otherwise except perhaps some impressions he had about government
officials living somewhat better than the average citizen lived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he ever discuss with you, or was there discussed in your
presence, the Communist Party as distinct from the Russian Government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he discuss with you, or was there discussed in your presence,
his political philosophy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Uh&mdash;I would say that at the point in his life which I knew him,
he was somewhat confused about philosophy. He did not seem particularly
happy with the form of government we have in this country or with government
as it exists anywhere. I think he had been&mdash;and perhaps still was&mdash;a partisan
of a Communist form of government, but, as it is practiced in Russia, I don't
think that he liked it at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. What else was discussed on this&mdash;was it a Sunday
afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; there was a discussion about Lee's job&mdash;which I believe he
had just left the Friday before. He was&mdash;he terminated his employment. I
don't know if he was fired or how he became severed from it&mdash;and he wanted
to move to Dallas. And there was some discussion about the move and it taking
place, and so on, and I cannot be sure now whether it was this Sunday or the
following Sunday that Marina came to stay in my home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I tend to think that it was that Sunday afternoon that we invited
her to come and stay with us, and I believe Lee <span class="locked">said&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the event he went to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No; to actually come and stay with us from that Sunday evening
forward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Uh&mdash;during their move. Just to give her a place to live until
he was able to find a job here in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was, therefore, your impression, I take it, that your invitation
was not tendered because of any difficulties between Marina and Lee, but rather
to afford her a place to live temporarily until Lee became established elsewhere?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That's right. In Dallas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I mean, my statement is a fair statement of the then atmosphere?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; I, at that time, was not aware that there was any marital
disharmony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, I'm going to ask you that question as of that
afternoon. What was your impression, if you have any, of the relationship
between Marina and Lee as of that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. As of that time, it appeared to be normal&mdash;normal man and wife
relationship. I think it was somewhat strained by a language barrier. Some
of the people present, not speaking Russian, and she did not speak any English,
and this left somewhat of a burden upon the others present to interpret the
conversations from one side or the other. But I was not able to sense any
disharmony at that point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, by the time you had arrived at their home, had you had
some notion of why you were invited to be present on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Only to meet them and I hoped to learn something about Russia
and how people live there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. How long did this meeting take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Uh&mdash;I believe from about 4 until 7.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have anything to eat during that period of time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you now related all the subjects discussed at that meeting
having a relation to the Oswalds and any part you would play in their lives?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Uh&mdash;well, as I mentioned before, it was difficult to remember
whether it was that Sunday or the following Sunday, but I tend to think that
that Sunday evening, Marina and her daughter, June, returned to Dallas with
my wife and I and that Lee <span class="locked">stayed&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was at the time of that first meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; at the time of the first meeting&mdash;at the end of it. And that
Lee stayed in Fort Worth that night and that he and Mrs. Hall, some time the
next day, moved their bigger belongings&mdash;more bulky ones other than clothing&mdash;to
Mrs. Hall's garage and stored them there. And then he came to Dallas and&mdash;uh&mdash;took
up residence at the Y.M.C.A. here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh. Now, do you know, as a matter of fact, that he did take
residence at the Y.M.C.A.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long did Marina remain with you and your wife in your
home, commencing that Sunday night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Approximately 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she brought with her what&mdash;in addition to her child, of
course?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Just clothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were residing then where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. At 3519 Fairmount.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In what town?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Dallas, Tex. I believe it was apartment 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You say you spoke no Russian, you understood no Russian, your
then wife understood a few words of Russian but had difficulty with the
language?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did you get along about your social intercourse between
Marina on the one hand, yourself and your wife on the other, during this week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. My social intercourse with Marina during this period was somewhat
limited. She and my wife at that time, Alex, were able to&mdash;uh&mdash;not to
discuss anything, but were able to communicate sufficiently to get along and
perhaps even enjoy each other's company to some extent. My son and their
daughter, June, are within a month of the same age; so that helped the barrier
of language somewhat in their being able to play with the children and the
children play with each other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she have any visitors during that week&mdash;or did you say
2 weeks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Two weeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
Mrs. De Mohrenschildt, on one occasion I remember specifically, and probably
Mr. De Mohrenschildt, and George Bouhe came one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you hear anything from Lee Oswald during that 2-week
period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you first hear from him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I think on either the following Monday or Tuesday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That would be the next day or the day after the Sunday meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; I believe I, or someone, talked to Lee on the telephone and
I believe I went down and got him. I went down to the Y.M.C.A.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Here in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Here in Dallas, on two or three occasions, and picked him up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you go in to pick him up or did you find him in front of
the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Uh&mdash;I think I did both. I remember specifically once going into
the desk and asking for him and then telephoning him to come down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You asked for him, you were given a room number, you used
the house telephone to call him? Is that a fair statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Something&mdash;I just remember that I went in and asked for him
and he came down. I did not go up to the room, but I do remember going
in and his coming down to meet me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. I think it might be helpful, now, if you would continue
from the point after your 3-hour visit in the Oswald apartment late Sunday
afternoon and early evening. You then took Marina to your home. Your recollection
is that the next contact you had was that there had been a telephone
call by Lee to your home. As a result of that call, you went to the Y.M.C.A.
Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, why did you go to the Y.M.C.A. as a result of that call?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. To pick him up so that he might visit his wife.</p>

<p>(Recess: 3:35 p.m. Reconvened: 3:50 p.m.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now where were we?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Let's see, I believe I was talking, awhile back, about people
that had seen them during this period, and I mentioned that there was only
George Bouhe and Mr. and Mrs. De Mohrenschildt. And George Bouhe came
by just, I think, to be sociable, and to see if he could give Lee any suggestions
on where he might look for a job. And at some point during this <span class="locked">period&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is the 2-week period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; the 2-week period&mdash;Mrs. De Mohrenschildt came by and
picked Marina up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. At my home&mdash;and took her, I believe, to a dentist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, how do you know this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Well, it sticks in my mind because while the two of them were
gone, Marina's little girl, June, cried almost constantly because, I guess, it
was the first time she had ever been away from her mother&mdash;and she cried
constantly and wouldn't even eat for the whole period Marina was gone&mdash;which,
as I remember it, was the better part of 1 day. I think she had two
teeth pulled, or something. I'm not sure about what was done other than that
she did go to see, I think a charity&mdash;went to a charity dental clinic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it is your distinct recollection that she was taken to the
charity dental clinic by your step-mother-in-law?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. My mother-in-law. There's no "step" to me. Just mother-in-law.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. All right. By your mother-in-law.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That would be a stepmother to my wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Did you ever take Marina to a dental clinic?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No&mdash;not to my recollection. I didn't take&mdash;uh&mdash;Marina anyplace
that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you familiar with the Baylor University College of
Dentistry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No; I know that there is one here; that they have one out at
Baylor Hospital&mdash;but I'm not familiar with it otherwise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you fix the period when Marina was in your home&mdash;first,
the month?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Uh&mdash;it was in September of 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And all of the stay was in the month of September, and none
of it in the month of October 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. My memory, as I say, is not clear back that far. But&mdash;uh&mdash;I
personally have no recollection of dates involved. Even when I was first interviewed,
I believed it to be during this period we are talking about. It was
pinpointed for me one time that it would&mdash;that Lee left his job on or about
the 6th of September and that, just going from that date, why it would, presuming,
as I remember, that that was a Friday in 1962, I believe that they came&mdash;she
came to my home for a period of 2 weeks after that. I don't believe that
it lasted any longer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During this period, did you have occasion in calling from your
home or place of business to call Lee Oswald at the Y.M.C.A.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I believe I&mdash;uh&mdash;I may not have personally. I may have dialed
the telephone for Marina and asked for him so that she could talk to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, did you ever seek to reach him by telephone either for
yourself or for Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I don't specifically remember an occasion doing that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall any occasion when you made a telephone call to
the Y.M.C.A. in an effort to reach Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No; not specifically. I could only say that it is probable that
I would have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall whether Mrs. Taylor ever made an effort to do so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No; I don't recall her having made an effort to do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I'll put it this way: Did you ever have any trouble finding
Lee Oswald, whether by telephone or direct visit, at the Y.M.C.A.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I never had any trouble locating him at the Y.M.C.A. when I
made an attempt to. I never remember any difficulty in contacting him there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I gather that Marina's visit at your home terminated at
the end of about 2 weeks. Did anything occur during those 2 weeks about which
we have not talked that arrested your attention?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Uh&mdash;nothing, outside of possibly some insights into Marina&mdash;I
mean, her personality and how she acted. There was nothing that arrested
my attention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Tell us about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Uh&mdash;she personally seemed to be person of a number of fine
qualities&mdash;an excellent mother, possibly even doting too much upon her child,
and a clean person in her habits and, as best she could, in her dress. And
she seemed very intelligent and interested in learning all that she could about
her new environment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't mean her new environment in your home&mdash;you
mean&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I'm talking about in this country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. And I do have one recollection pursuant to this about her desire
to learn English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I was going to ask you about that. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. During the period that I knew them, on several occasions, this
subject came up. And Lee was in opposition to her learning English&mdash;not&mdash;he
would not come out, at least, never did around me, and say that he didn't
want her to learn English but&mdash;uh&mdash;he was or did appear to be in opposition to
it. And George De Mohrenschildt prepared for Marina several lessons in
English&mdash;and I believe that Lee later took them away from her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I would like to have you give me as much on this series of incidents,
with respect to her learning the English language and becoming more
proficient in its use. First&mdash;as to what you based your present comments upon,
by way of what occurred, that you recall? Something occurred to her to lead
you to state as you have stated in terms of conclusion that Lee did not wish her
to learn the English language. And, secondly, that Lee took from her the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
English language lessons. I assume they were on sheets of paper. Is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That George Bouhe had prepared for her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. George De Mohrenschildt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; that George De Mohrenschildt had prepared for her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I remember asking Lee about his opposition to it on one occasion
and as I remember he told me that&mdash;uh&mdash;or brushed it aside by saying, "It
isn't necessary at this time"&mdash;something like that. And then, of course, he
did take the lessons from her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Uh&mdash;because, as I remember, this was the first time that I had
knowledge of her being beaten by him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Tell us about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. As I remember it, shortly after they moved, Mrs. De <span class="locked">Mohrenschildt&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They moved where? Into your home or from your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Moved into their apartment here in Dallas&mdash;the first apartment
they had, on Elsbeth.</p>

<p>Mrs. De Mohrenschildt came by and told us that she had seen Marina and
that she had a black eye, I believe, and was crying and said that she and Lee
had had a fight over the lessons and they had been taken from her, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Lee had struck her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; that Lee had struck her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She said that to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; this is Mrs. De Mohrenschildt now. This is not Marina
that said that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; I appreciate that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. And&mdash;not pursuant to that, but while we are speaking of their
marital troubles, I seem to remember on one occasion where Marina left&mdash;I
think this was somewhat later, probably in <span class="locked">November&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Left the home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Left Lee and went to stay with someone&mdash;I don't remember
who. It may have been this woman in Irving that she was living with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Mrs. Paine. I do not know where she went except that I was
told that she had left him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Anything else that comes to your mind with respect
to their relations, one with the other, and whatnot, covering this 2-week span
while she was a visitor in your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. The only other observation I would make is that&mdash;again, it has
to do with relationship between them&mdash;and that is that to my knowledge at
all the meetings between them that I was present at during this 2-week period,
there was no personal communication between them&mdash;at least, that I was able
to determine. Of course, I couldn't understand them when they spoke to each
other in Russian. But, certainly, for this length of time, you would think
that a man and woman married would want some time alone together. They
could have&mdash;we had parks nearby, within one door of us was a big park where
they could have taken walks and been alone together and talked&mdash;but this
never happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. It was just like two friends meeting. There was nothing intimate
or personal between them at these meetings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No expressions that you could understand or, at least, conduct
between them that would lead you to believe there were evidences of love and
affection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was more platonic&mdash;a friendship relationship?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he visit on more than one occasion in your home during the
2-week period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; on several occasions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And on these occasions, was it always that he called and asked
to come over, or were you told that he was coming and there had been a previous
arrangement&mdash;or what do you recall as to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Well, I think perhaps once or twice Marina instigated their
meetings, would call him and he would then come.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he always transported, or did he <span class="locked">come&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I think he may even have come by himself once or twice. We
were not far from downtown and had good bus service&mdash;and I remember at
least one occasion where he rode the bus. He left late one evening and rode
the bus back to town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any questions, at any time during the 2-week period or at any
other time, about his ability to operate an automobile on the streets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; there was discussion about this possibly on two or three
occasions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I don't remember him being present or having knowledge of
them. Mrs. De Mohrenschildt tried to get me to teach him how to drive, and
I never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You never got around to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I never had any time or inclination to use my automobile to
teach a beginner how to drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your understanding was from Mrs. De Mohrenschildt that he
was unable to operate an automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you had no direct conversation with him on the subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or with Marina through an interpreter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did this conversation with respect to inducing you to attempt
to teach him to drive a car occur in the presence of Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall whether Mrs. De Mohrenschildt then, in Russian,
spoke to Marina on the subject in your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No; I don't remember the details such as that on the various
discussions we had. I just remember that on several occasions they did try
to get me to do it, and I refused.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you receive or was there paid or offered to be paid to you
anything by them, Lee or Marina, financially for this generosity on your part
of keeping her in your home for that 2-week period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You never received anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you receive anything from anybody other than Marina and
Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You never received anything from anybody at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The answer is "Yes; you have never received anything from
anybody."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I never received any financial reimbursement for any of the
expenditures that I made on their behalf.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, the 2-week period concluded and was there
something that occurred in particular that brought about the termination of
that 2-week guest period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Mrs. Hall&mdash;I believe you said Elena&mdash;had an automobile accident
and I think Marina went to Fort Worth and lived in Mrs. Hall's home so
that she might help Mrs. Hall. Mrs. Hall was at least semibedridden. She
was certainly not able to get up and cook herself food and so on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was she living alone at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes she was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is, Mrs. Hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; the only reason I remember about Mr. Hall was by associating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
it with either Midland or Abilene&mdash;I don't remember which one. It was
west Texas anyway. And he was living there at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And her leaving your home then&mdash;there was no cause or reason
for it other than that, as you now understand or from your memory of it,
that Mrs. Hall had been involved in an automobile accident, was partially bedridden,
was having some difficulty in any respect; she was then by herself
because her husband was in west Texas and at that time they were, as you
understood, separated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Or divorced. I don't remember which.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Marina went to Mrs. Hall's home in Fort Worth to help
care for Mrs. Hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, that would take us to about the last week in November&mdash;somewhere
in that area&mdash;I mean September&mdash;is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. September; I should think; yes. Toward the end of September,
and possibly even early in October&mdash;again, due to time, this is all quite vague&mdash;I
had Lee with me. I don't remember where I got him. But Lee and my wife,
Alex, and I went to Fort Worth and picked up Marina and their child and
all of the Oswald's belongings that had, through this period, been stored
at Mrs. Hall's, and brought them to Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you went to Mrs. Hall's&mdash;is that where you went?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you reached the Halls' you picked up the Oswalds' house
paraphernalia, clothing and other <span class="locked">things&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or whatever had been stored at the Halls' you picked up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, your recollection doesn't serve you at the moment to be
more specific as to how this came about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. It doesn't. Not at all. I can't even remember now where I got
Lee that day. I wish I could&mdash;for several reasons you are probably aware of.
But I don't remember.</p>

<p>And, at any rate, we went to Fort <span class="locked">Worth&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me.</p>

<p>Do you recall being interviewed by two agents of the FBI on the 29th of
January 1964.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would it refresh your recollection did you tell those agents at
that time that you picked up Lee Oswald at the curb of the YMCA in Dallas
and drove to Fort Worth to the Hall residence where Marina was living?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Well, it is refreshing to my memory, but I would like to say
this about it.</p>

<p>That in the course of several interviews by the FBI, the Secret Service, and
the Dallas Police Department which have occurred, and between these and since
the last one, I have naturally tried to remember all that I can concerning the
areas in which I was vague in my memory. And at my last interview concerning
this one particular item, it occurred to me that at one time&mdash;once&mdash;I went
to&mdash;uh&mdash;and looked for a place where Lee was staying in the Oak Cliff area of
Dallas and tried to locate him. I remember going and trying to locate him.
I don't remember whether I found him or whether I did not. I know that&mdash;uh&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Can you pinpoint this as to time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No; that's the trouble. I can't pinpoint it as to time. I just
remember some vague directions <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What about year&mdash;1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. 1962 definitely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it had to be some time <span class="locked">after&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. It had to be some time between September and November 15,
because my wife and I separated after that. Anyway, at some point during
this period, I do remember going to an area in Oak Cliff and looking for Lee.
I don't think I found him&mdash;at least, not on the occasion I remember. All I had
was some vague directions <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Well, directly from my wife but indirectly I believe that came
to her from Mrs. De Mohrenschildt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you requested to seek to locate him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I don't know why I was trying to locate him. I don't remember
anything except I remember driving around one area one evening looking for
a residence of his on some vague directions. As I say, I don't even remember
if it was a residence of the whole family or just of Lee.</p>

<p>I went back to this area within the last few weeks and located a building
that stuck&mdash;or I had a recollection of one building in this area and I went back
to the area and found it and gave that information to Agent Yelchek of the
FBI. I don't know what <span class="locked">he&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What location was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I gave him the exact street address&mdash;but it seems to me like
it was&mdash;well, the name of the apartment building was the Coz-I-Eight [spelling]
C-o-z&mdash;I&mdash;E-i-g-h-t&mdash;apartments, and I think they were located at 1404 North
Beckley. But the address I could be off on; but the name I do remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What kind of a building was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. An apartment building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Brick?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A more substantial-type thing than you had seen the Oswalds
occupy prior thereto?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Repeat, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was this a building of a substantiality higher caliber than the
Elsbeth Street home, for example?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Uh&mdash;I would say it was in the same class.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did the occasion arise in which Lee Oswald called you to ask
you to assist in moving him and Marina to an apartment in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I'm not sure how definitely that was&mdash;I'm not definitely sure
how that was instigated. I'm not sure. It was either Lee directly or Mrs.
De Mohrenschildt that asked for this assistance in moving. Whichever it was,
my wife and I got together with Lee, I believe, on a Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you pick him up or did he come to your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I cannot remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he have anything with him in the way of luggage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I believe he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Describe it, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I believe he had a paper bag of clothing, a rather large one, and
an old leather suitcase. And that he had these two containers of personal belongings,
and we went to Fort Worth and added Marina's to this&mdash;Marina's belongings
and the household furnishings, whatever they were, and brought it all to
the Elsbeth Street apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, did you pile all of this clothing and household furniture,
to the extent they had any, in the rear of your automobile, and haul it back to
Dallas? Or how did you do this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I rented a trailer in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, where did you rent that trailer? Where was the place
located from which you rented the trailer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I do not remember. I have even been to this place recently again
with Mr. Yelchek of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. And we went over
one evening and pinpointed the location of that service station where I had
rented a small covered trailer <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A small covered trailer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; it was covered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And give me the location of the place you pinpointed with
Mr. Yelchek.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I don't remember an address on the service station. It is a mile
or so north of Texas Christian University in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. Does University Drive sort of refresh your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. It&mdash;uh&mdash;could be University; yeah. However, it was not
University Drive. It was another street which I just can't remember. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
service station was west of the South Freeway, as I say, about a mile north
of Texas Christian University.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I did originally think that it was on University but, upon investigation
of the&mdash;visual investigation, actually being there one evening, why
we did locate it and it was in another place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The place that you located when Mr. Yelchek accompanied you
was different from the one that you had remembered when you first talked
to the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; however, it, in my mind, is a positive identification. There
is no question about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your more recent one is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; when Mr. Yelchek and I went. I was able to positively
identify the location. I might add, after having talked to him since then, that
the owner says that&mdash;or there is no record of the rental at this location. There
seems to be a set of duplicate books involved&mdash;one for themselves and one
for the National Trailer Co., whichever one it was. A little fraud, or something,
involved in that. We didn't get too involved in it&mdash;just to know that
there wasn't any record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is the name J. H. Pendley familiar to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have your driver's license with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you look at it and tell me what the number of it is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. 1606670. And that's my memory that's talking.</p>

<p>(Witness then takes the driver's license from billfold and hands to Mr.
Jenner.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1606670.</p>

<p>(Hands license back to witness.)</p>

<p>Did the people from whom you rented the trailer take your driver's license
number on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I don't remember. It's common&mdash;in fact, it's normal procedure
to take the license number&mdash;driver's license and vehicle license.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long have you had that number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. It's permanent in the State of Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So you had it on this occasion&mdash;the same number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What's the practice in Texas in respect to license numbers? Do
you get a new one every year, or do you get a sticker&mdash;or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Vehicle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. They change from year to year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They change the number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; they do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you, by any chance, remember your license number in 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you ever recall having a license number with the digit letters
"E" and "Y"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I would never have a license tag with that number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With those prefix letters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; as long as I lived in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why is that, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. The "E" prefix&mdash;the prefixes beginning with "E" are for Tarrant
County, of which Fort Worth is a part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you being in Dallas County, your initials are what&mdash;your
prefixes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. In Dallas County they would be some of the "M" prefix, all of
the "N" and "P".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. "N" as in "Nancy," "P" as in "Paul"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; and some of the "M" as in "Mary."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But it would be a combination of two or more of those three
letters?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. It would be a combination of two letters beginning with the
three that we have just been discussing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From one of the three we have just discussed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Beginning with either an M, an N, or a P. All of the N's and
P's&mdash;like NA or NS or PA or PZ.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>You piled all this material in the covered trailer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was on a Sunday, as I recall your saying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you return that trailer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. The same day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you went from Mrs. Hall's to where with the loaded trailer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I took the loaded trailer to an apartment on Elsbeth Street in
Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And then what happened when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. We unloaded it and I returned the trailer to the service station
where I had rented it in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you pay for the renting of that trailer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I don't remember for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, somebody paid for it. It wasn't just given to you, was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No. It wasn't given to me. I do not remember, however, who
paid for it. I&mdash;it comes to mind that Lee probably did&mdash;but I can't say specifically
that Lee did it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Lee accompany you to the service station to rent the trailer
in the first instance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your recollection does not serve you now as to whether upon
its return, he paid for it or you did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No; payment would be in advance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That would be an out-of-pocket payment. Would you say your
recollection is, in view of your haziness about it, that you did not pay for it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You returned the trailer. Did you help put the household furniture
and whatnot into their apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you do that before you returned the trailer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. After you returned the trailer, did you return to their apartment
that same afternoon or evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I can't be absolutely sure whether I returned that evening or
not. I'm not sure whether they went back with us or not. I <span class="locked">don't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Back with you where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Back to Fort Worth to return the trailer.</p>

<p>I don't know if they took that ride over there with us or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That would be how much of a ride?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Uh&mdash;round trip it would take probably 1 hour and 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is the distance from the Elsbeth Street address to Fort
Worth&mdash;just approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Well, to the place in Fort Worth where the trailer was rented,
I would say, it was about 30 miles. And, in case you're wondering about the
time, it's all a turnpike and expressway trip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Did you see the Oswalds, or either of them, after that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Next, and under what circumstances?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Sometime after the move&mdash;I am not, again, can't be specific about
dates&mdash;my memory isn't that good&mdash;I visited them by myself, and I believe
that the purpose of that visit specifically was to return a manuscript, or at
least it's been called that, certainly just a collection of notes Lee had that he
had compiled on his visit to Fort Worth&mdash;I mean, on his visit to Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I show you in a volume which has a sticker on its front entitled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
"Affidavits and Statements Taken in Connection with the Assassination of
the President," which has been supplied to me by the Dallas city police, and
I direct your attention to pages 148 to 157. And I ask you whether those pages
are familiar to you as being either all or a part of what you now describe as
notes prepared by Lee Oswald on his trip or life in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Can we go off the record and let me look at this a minute?
It will be a minute, because I only looked at part of this thing.</p>

<p>(Witness peruses document page by page.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you examined those pages, which are a photostatic copy
of what purports to be a draft by Lee Harvey Oswald of various stages of his
life, including time in Russia, in the Marines, the period in New Orleans, and
what not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Those are not the same pages of which I was speaking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I should advise you, Mr. Taylor, that they are incomplete. That
is, we are advised that there are other sheets which we don't happen to have.
I could ask you this: Was it on the type of paper which is indicated in these
photostats&mdash;that is, lined 8 by 11½ sheets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No; it was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it ringed notebook paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No; it was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you familiar with Lee Oswald's handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No; I am not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was this material you saw in his handwriting or was it typed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I would not know&mdash;this material? I'm sorry. I was thinking
<span class="locked">about&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The material that you saw, was that in his handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. It was typed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was typed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. It was typed&mdash;on white paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Plain white paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I interrupted you because you had mentioned something he
showed you. Now, would you please go on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; and the occasion for this visit that I was talking about was
to return what has been discussed as a manuscript. And I had had this in my
possession from the time Marina had been staying with us. I had asked him
for it then and intended to read it. I did not ever read it fully. I read a page
or two of it&mdash;of which my recollection is very dim. I remember almost nothing
about it except that it seemed to be in a narrative style and was about his
experiences in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What impression did you have as to spelling, grammar, or content?
Was it the writing of an educated man, or was it sophomoric in character,
or do you have any impression about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I don't have any impression&mdash;having read so little of it such a
long time ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, you went to see him to return this manuscript?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where was he living?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. He was still living on Elsbeth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you reached their apartment, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was she home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes, she was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you visit with them on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; I did. I was treated as a very welcome guest. I assumed,
at the time, that the reason for that was I was probably the only guest they had
had&mdash;or at least certainly that guests were unusual, and that I was very welcome.
As a matter of fact, almost immediately after I arrived, Marina left and
walked some two and a half blocks to a doughnut shop and bought some doughnuts
and returned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
And we just talked briefly that evening&mdash;not about anything in great detail.
I stayed&mdash;I didn't go to stay a long time, just to return the manuscript, but due
to the hospitality that was extended, I stayed perhaps an hour or 2 hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did they appear, in their relations one to the other, on this
occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. It appeared that&mdash;uh&mdash;they were getting along well. When I
arrived, the baby was asleep and they were both in the kitchen. He was sitting
at a table, I think, reading <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A book or a newspaper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Reading a book or a newspaper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. A book, I believe. I think he checked out a number of books from
the library.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you understand him to be an avid reader?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever observe what character of books he was reading?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. As I remember, they were primarily political philosophy. I
don't remember any titles specifically. I think he did have a copy of&mdash;uh&mdash;at
one time, of something by Karl Marx. I don't remember the title or name of
the book.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. "Das Kapital"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I'm aware of that title&mdash;but I just don't remember what he
had a copy of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But they were <span class="locked">political&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Books on political philosophy, governmental structure, and
philosophy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I would say primarily on philosophy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Philosophy or theories of government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. You had, I gather, a reasonably pleasant visit on
this particular evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see them again after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I did not see both of them again after that. Sometime much
<span class="locked">later&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is much later but prior to November 15, 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Prior to November of 1963? Is that what you meant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I had concluded you were speaking of prior <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No; I did make contact with them after my separation&mdash;if that's
what you are alluding to. In the spring of 1963 I dropped by this Elsbeth apartment
building and, finding no one at home, I asked someone who was sitting in
the courtyard about them. And I think he was the manager. And he told me
that they had moved and he told me where they had moved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. He told me that they had moved into a small apartment about
a block away. And I went there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What street was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What town?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Dallas&mdash;about a block away from Elsbeth. And, anyway, I went
to this&mdash;where I had been directed, and found Marina at home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was Lee at home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No, he was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What day of the week was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why did you go there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Just for a friendly visit.</p>

<p>Marina was at home. She&mdash;her English had improved enough for her to
get across to me a few ideas. She said that Lee was not home, that&mdash;uh&mdash;I
don't remember her saying where he was. She said that he was attending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
night school, Crozier Tech here in Dallas&mdash;which is our technical high school
<span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was this occasion in the early evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I think it was in midafternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Midafternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you certain about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; uh&mdash;because this apartment in question had a small balcony
on the front of it and I remember the door was open and I thought what a
nice place for the baby to play and some of the baby's toys&mdash;a ball and something
or other&mdash;were out there on this porch, and I thought how much nicer
this was than the apartment they had had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that what led you to suggest that it was in the afternoon
rather than the early evening? It doesn't get dark here in Texas&mdash;and this
was what? The spring, did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes. No; you are trying to say that it may have been early
evening, although it was still quite light. My memory tells me that it was
midafternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Was anything said about the fact he was working?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I don't remember her saying what he was doing or if he was
working at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I shouldn't have used the term "working"&mdash;whether he was
employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Uh&mdash;I don't think at that time he was. Again, it's just a very,
very vague recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was she able to communicate with you, or you to understand,
as to what studies he was pursuing at Crozier Tech?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No; I don't believe that I remember what he was studying
at all at Crozier Tech.</p>

<p>I did inform Marina of my impending divorce and&mdash;uh&mdash;in other words,
telling her that Mrs. Taylor and I were no longer living together and we
had separated. Uh&mdash;and she said that she had been ill, I believe. And&mdash;uh&mdash;she
invited me to come back in the evening and I left. And I would say the whole
interview with her took certainly no longer than 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh. And this, as you recall, was in 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was anything said that his attendance at Crozier Tech was in
the night school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; it was in the night school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But your visit was in the midafternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she indicate to you that he was then at Crozier Tech or
that he would be at Crozier Tech that evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. She, I don't believe, indicated either thing to me. I don't&mdash;I
can't honestly say that she indicated where Lee was at the time. She may
have said he was at work or not at work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You just don't have enough recollection to know whether she
said he was employed and working and had work at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Uh&mdash;the general impression is that he was not working, but it
is not distinct enough to make a flat statement upon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that the last time you ever saw Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was the last time you ever saw Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. The previous occasion I have mentioned where I went to visit
them in the evening to return the manuscript. That was the last time I saw
Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was prior to November 15, 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; I don't know why he wanted that manuscript at that time.
I know that he wanted it very badly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He called you for it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Uh&mdash;yes, he did. On two occasions. And, on the second one,
I think I got in the car and took it to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh. He called you on the telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, before I go to the De Mohrenschildts, I'd like you now to
give me&mdash;now that we've had this discussion between us&mdash;your impressions of
the Oswalds individually.</p>

<p>(Off-the-record discussion followed.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Uh&mdash;my impression, first, of Lee would be that&mdash;uh&mdash;he was,
first, rather confused, particularly, politically. He wanted to be well-informed
and an idealist. He considered himself well-informed. I don't think he was
even very knowledgeable on the subject.</p>

<p>In our conversations, when I would take exception to something he had said
and argue a point with him, why, superficially, he could make a statement or
support an idea that is commonly regarded in some areas as being true&mdash;such as,
well, the Republican and Democratic Parties have different ideas on how things
should be done just as democracy and communism have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. And he could present Communist ideas to a point that it was
very superficial&mdash;and when you started digging down in to the meat of the subject,
why, Lee was through.</p>

<p>He seemed to have perhaps read quite a bit of political philosophy, but when
it came to really understanding it, he couldn't present a very good case for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he emotional in that respect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. He would&mdash;uh&mdash;not any more so than anyone else you would get
into a political discussion with. This seems to be a fairly emotional subject on
everyone's part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You didn't regard him as a vicious type&mdash;as a man who would
think in terms of inflicting bodily harm if frustrated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Uh&mdash;well, I thought of him as a man who&mdash;uh&mdash;would kick a dog
or beat his wife, but&mdash;uh&mdash;I was never afraid of him because I never felt like
that he would attack anything his equal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were a bigger man than he, weren't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Well, even a person&mdash;even a grown human being, any male, I
wouldn't ever have expected this of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Regardless of size?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Regardless of size.</p>

<p>Anything that could present a forceful retaliation, why, I would not have
expected him <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he mild-mannered, <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. He tended to be, in temperament, a little hot; but there was a
very definite limit to it&mdash;even suggesting some inner cowardness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever have occasion to observe Marina when she had any
black and blue marks on her person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. [Pausing before reply.] No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he ever mention the Kennedys or the Connallys?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he ever mention the administration of either of them or
their policies?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Uh&mdash;no; I'm not even sure that Connally was in office at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, he was Secretary of the Navy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That's right. I was thinking of him as Governor.</p>

<p>I never heard Lee take exception to Government officials; take exception to
Government policies&mdash;definitely&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We all do this sometimes but never to the human being that
might formulate them. Just to the policy itself. Did he ever mention Jack Ruby
or Jack Rubenstein in your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he a drinking man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Give me as best you can now recall&mdash;did you ever loan him any
money or give him any money?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you did things for him. You made expenditures in their
behalf?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever pay for any of the dental care administered to
Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No. To my knowledge, that expense was borne by the county.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At least, you never assumed any of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you now told us all of the occasions in which you either
expended funds in their behalf or for them or accorded them help in your home,
or otherwise were charitable to them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you aware that he was employed here in Dallas by Jaggars-Chiles-Stovall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You ever pick him up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you ever observe with respect to his cleanliness, his
personal habits in that respect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That his clothes, generally, appeared to have been worn several
days, and it was always in question as to when he had taken his last bath.
He was not a clean person, either in clothing or personally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any contrast in that respect between himself and
Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was fastidious, was she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; very much so. And the same thing applied to her treatment
of the child. It never had a damp diaper on if she knew about it. It just had
to be damp&mdash;it didn't have to be wet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever see him dressed up in the sense that you and I
are dressed now&mdash;in a business coat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No. To my knowledge, he did not own any clothing that would be
acceptable in what we would call business circles, say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever see him with a tie on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Give me your judgment as to the relationship between Lee Oswald
and George De Mohrenschildt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Uh&mdash;it's difficult to assess their relationship because there probably
was more to it than I ever saw. But what little of it I saw, they were
quite in opposition to each other&mdash;such as the lessons in English for Marina.
But I certainly think that they must have been closer than they appeared or
the De Mohrenschildts wouldn't have been so active in seeing that they got
along well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have any opinion as to whether George De Mohrenschildt
exercised any influence over Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; there seemed to be a great deal of influence there. It would
be my guess that De Mohrenschildt encouraged him to move to Dallas, and
he suggested a number of things to Lee&mdash;such as where to look for jobs. And
it seems like whatever his suggestions were, Lee grabbed them and took them&mdash;whether
it was what time to go to bed or where to stay or to let Marina stay
with us while he stayed at the YMCA.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he tended to follow De Mohrenschildt's suggestions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I want to finish with the Oswalds before I get to the De Mohrenschildts.</p>

<p>(Looking through papers.)</p>

<p>Tell me, chronologically, about the De Mohrenschildts and your relationships
with them and who these various De Mohrenschildts are?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. In other words, I will go back time-wise and bring you up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. He was born in Russia, I believe in Georgia. This is, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
all what I had been told for a while here. He was born in Russia and I believe
he went to <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, this is what you were told and heard while you <span class="locked">were&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Married to his daughter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. His daughter. And this comes by way of conversations over
a long period of time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. He was born in Russia and, I believe, to a titled family. He
claimed for himself the title of Baron. Original name was von Mohrenschildt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. [Spelling] v-o-n?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That's right. And that he came to this country&mdash;when, I'm not
sure, but certainly prior to 1939 when he was associated with the University of
Texas in the capacity of instructor or professor in their Geology Department.
And he married my former wife's mother in New York City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Repeat the names, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. He married my former wife, Alex's, mother&mdash;the present Mrs.
Brandel&mdash;in New York City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was it your information that that was his first wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. To my knowledge, that was his first wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. They married approximately 3 months before she was born.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Before your wife was born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Before my wife was born, and that their divorce came rather
quickly after she was born.</p>

<p>And, from that time until he married the wife, Dee or Dee Dee, my knowledge
of him is rather sketchy. I know that, at least, part of the time they were
married he resided in Dallas, was evidently well-established in business here,
and owned a home&mdash;which, I believe, he had built to his own plans&mdash;and was
generally well-accepted here in the business community.</p>

<p>And then he gets a little vague&mdash;at least to my knowledge&mdash;after that until
1958 or 1959 when I first met him&mdash;1958, I'm sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he then married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. He was then not married, to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. He was living with the present Mrs. De Mohrenschildt but they
were not married; also living with them was her daughter, Christiana or
Chris or Jeanne, Jr.&mdash;whatever the particular alias she felt like at the
moment. And I met them through her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you say "her," <span class="locked">which&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Through Christiana, Jeanne's daughter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whom you subsequently married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No. This would be the half-sister. I guess it is a half-sister
of my wife's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. We should say, at this point, your former wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. My former wife. This sure is involved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are doing all right. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. And I met Christiana through a mutual girl friend and we dated
over a period of a few weeks and then she left Dallas and started attending
U.C.L.A. as a student, and I don't believe I saw her any more until&mdash;uh&mdash;May or
June of 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the mutual friend through whom you became acquainted
a Nancy Tilton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No, no; the mutual friend was a girl named Judy Mandel, of
Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is the name Nancy Tilton familiar to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who is she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. She is a cousin of my wife at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your wife's name was Alexandra?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>At any rate, I met&mdash;uh&mdash;at this time, I asked Chris out on a date and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
said that she had her little sister&mdash;I think is the way she termed it at that
time&mdash;visiting her, and could I find someone for her to go out with at the same
time. And I did that, and I think we went out&mdash;couples of four, or two
couples&mdash;on two occasions. And then I started dating the younger of the
girls, which was Alex. And, during this time, why, I was in or around their
home for a whole summer&mdash;in fact, until the time we married, and quite
intimate with the whole family. Does that bring it chronologically up to date&mdash;or
would you like the otherwise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I don't know what the "otherwise" is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I skipped Mrs. Brandel in this, I think. They were married,
as I mentioned, in New York City approximately 3 months before my former
wife was born and divorced shortly thereafter. And he stayed away&mdash;or stayed
in the background of Alex's life until 1958 when he and Mrs. Brandel, his former
wife and Alex's mother went into court and sued the previously mentioned
Mrs. Tilton for her custody.</p>

<p>When Alex was born, Mrs. Tilton paid by check, which I saw, Mrs. Brandel
$5,000 for custody of the daughter, Alex; and they had to go into court and get
this custody set aside&mdash;at which time the daughter went to Paris and lived
with Mrs. Brandel, where she lived at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The daughter&mdash;this is Christiana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. We're talking still about my former wife, Alex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your former wife lived in Paris?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; my former wife, after the custody suit, was taken to
Paris by her mother where she lived until the spring of 1959, when I met her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, while she was in Paris, were you dating Christiana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; however, I was not even aware of Alex's existence until
I met her that evening, as previously described.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you information as to where Jeanne was born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. In China.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's the present Mrs. De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>My knowledge of her is that&mdash;uh&mdash;it's rather sketchy, because that's all my
former wife knew of her.</p>

<p>She was born in China. I believe her parentage, at least on one side, was
Russian. She claimed that, at any rate. And she traveled through her late
teens and early twenties&mdash;I don't know exactly how long&mdash;with her former
husband, Mr. Bogovallenskia, as ballet performers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. I have a spelling of that name, Mr. Taylor, which is
B-o-g-o-v-a-l-l-e-n-s-k-i-a [spelling].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That may be more correct. This is phonetic here that I have
[referring to paper].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that a maiden name or a married name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That is her married name&mdash;Jeanne's married name <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is Jeanne the same as Christiana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No; Jeanne is the mother. Christiana is the daughter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That is the name of Christiana's father and the man I was just
saying that Jeanne traveled with as ballet performers in China.</p>

<p>All of the press clippings I saw, I think, were prior to World War II. And,
as far as Mr. Bogo&mdash;as far as Chris' father is concerned, he was in Dallas
during 1959 or 1960 and&mdash;uh&mdash;he had severe mental problems and Chris returned
with him to California where, the last I heard, he was resident of a
State mental hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>And Chris is now married to a gentleman whose given name is Ragnar
[spelling] R-a-g-n-a-r, but you don't recall his surname?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Uh&mdash;I do not. My memory is rather vague, but it seems to me
like, in connection with his name, that his father is either a vice president or is
the executive vice president of Hughes Aircraft.</p>

<p>I don't know anything about him other than that except I was told he is a
physicist, as Chris' father is, and he is a rather unusual character to meet and
to know&mdash;being somewhat of a beatnik. But, at least, he seems to, when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
works, be able to make an awful lot of money and he must have money because
they&mdash;Ragnar and Chris&mdash;honeymooned on a yacht that he owned, and to my
knowledge, since he has not worked&mdash;which is a period of 2 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does George De Mohrenschildt have a brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What's his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Uh&mdash;he uses George De Mohrenschildt's original name of Von
Mohrenschildt. He is a professor at an ivy league university&mdash;Cambridge, I
think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, Cambridge would be Harvard. What about Princeton?
What about Dartmouth? Columbia? Brown? Cornell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. At the moment, I don't remember. I should remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever meet him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I never met him. I believe I talked to him on the telephone.
He passed through Dallas and called. I just talked to him briefly on the
telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, give me your impression of De Mohrenschildt. First, describe
him. What kind of personality is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Uh&mdash;he is a rather overbearing personality; somewhat boisterous
in nature and easily changeable moods&mdash;anywhere from extreme friendliness
to downright dislike&mdash;just like turning on and off a light.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What about his physical characteristics? Large, small, handsome,
or otherwise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. He's a large man, in height he's only about 6'2" but he's a very
powerfully built man, like a boxer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Athletic?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. He is athletic. And he has a very big chest, which makes him
appear to be very much bigger than he actually is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, Mr. Taylor, do you know Mr. Liebeler? Mr. Liebeler is
a member of the staff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I don't believe I do. My letter told me that he would contact me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Give me a little more about the personality of George
De Mohrenschildt's&mdash;and I think I'm about ready to let you go home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I would say that he has an inflammable personality. And he's
very likable, when he wants to be, and he oftentimes uses this to get something
he wants, put a person in a good mood and then, by doing this, he tries to then
drag whatever it is that he wants out of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is he unconventional?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; I would say that they lead a somewhat Bohemian life.
The furnishings in their home somewhat show this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is he unconventional in dress?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; oftentimes wearing merely bathing trunks, and things
like this, that&mdash;for a man of his age, which is about 50 to 52&mdash;is a little unusual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean out on the street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. On the street, as a constant apparel.</p>

<p>He does not often work. In fact, during the times that I was married to
his daughter, I have not known of him to hold any kind of a position for which
he received monetary remuneration. So, as a result, why, he could spend his
time at his favorite sport, which is tennis. And this could be in 32° weather
in the bathing shorts I mentioned&mdash;only.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On any time during the week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Any time during the week. They have always owned convertibles
and they would ride in them in all kinds of weather with the top
down. They are very active, outdoor sort of people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you say "they," you mean he and his present wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is she unconventional at times in her attire in the respects you
have indicated in regards to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; very similar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She, likewise, wears a bathing suit out on the street, does she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; quite a bit. And usually a Bikini.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What about his political philosophy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Uh&mdash;well, that's&mdash;uh&mdash;I have heard them say everything&mdash;from
saying that he was a Republican and she expressed democratic ideals, and they
expressed desires to return to Russia and live&mdash;so, it's all colors of the spectrum.
Anything that&mdash;again, so much of what they do is what fits the moment. Whatever
fits their designs or desires at the moment is the way they do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh. When did you marry your present wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. In&mdash;let's see&mdash;on November 21, 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your present wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Oh, I'm sorry. That was Mr. De Mohrenschildt's daughter that
I married on that date. We married on September 28, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you had any correspondence from either of the De Mohrenschildts
in which there have been any allusions to the assassination of President
Kennedy or to either of the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I have not personally received any correspondence at all from
them. My parents have received correspondence from them&mdash;none of which mentioned&mdash;I
take that back&mdash;in one case, the assassination was mentioned in
passing; and the Oswalds were not mentioned in specifics.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it, your parents are acquainted with the De Mohrenschildts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And does that acquaintance go back prior to your acquaintance
with the De Mohrenschildts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No; that acquaintance was after Alex and I got married.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. All right. Now, we have had some discussions off the
record. I will ask you first&mdash;is there anything you would like to add that
occurs to you that you think might be helpful&mdash;as an occurrence having taken
place or even general thoughts on your part&mdash;to the Commission in this important
investigation it has undertaken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Well, the only thing that occurred to me was that&mdash;uh&mdash;and I
guess it was from the beginning&mdash;that if there was any assistance or plotters
in the assassination that it was, in my opinion, most probably the De Mohrenschildts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On what do you base that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I base that on&mdash;uh&mdash;their desire, first of all, to&mdash;uh&mdash;return to
Russia at one time and live there; uh&mdash;they have traveled together behind the
Iron Curtain; uh&mdash;they took a trip to Mexico, through Mexico, on the avowed
purpose of walking from Laredo, Tex., to the tip of South <span class="locked">America&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Panama?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. <span class="locked">And&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On beyond that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Beyond&mdash;to the tip of South America&mdash;the southern tip of
South America.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Uh&mdash;and this they claim to have done, yet further information
indicated to me that their trip extended only to the portion of South America
where the Cuban refugees were being trained to invade Cuba and that this trip
coincided and that they were in the area while all this training was going on.
And, so, from that&mdash;from these <span class="locked">observations&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you conclude that they were attempting to spy on that invasion
preparation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; because where&mdash;they went to Guatemala where the invasion
troops were being trained, or they were in Guatemala when they were supposed
to be on a walking trip, and had taken up residence in the unoccupied home of
some acquaintances there and&mdash;unbeknowing to anyone&mdash;and when these acquaintances
<span class="locked">returned&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was the trip during the time you were married to their
daughter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are basing this information on communications from them,
conversations with your wife, conversations that occurred after they returned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; and to clarify it on the last point here, about them being in
Guatemala, in conversations with Nancy Tilton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; I asked you about her. Who is Nancy Tilton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Nancy Tilton is the cousin who brought up my former wife, Alex,
after she was born. Her mother never took her from the hospital. This Mrs.
Tilton did. And on a visit to Mrs. Tilton's home, the <span class="locked">people&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Tilton reared her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes; to age 14. On a visit to Mrs. Tilton's <span class="locked">home&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. In Tubac, Ariz. Uh&mdash;Mrs. Tilton remarked that some friends
of hers, the people in question in Guatemala, had found them living in their
<span class="locked">home&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had found the De Mohrenschildts there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes, living in their home in Guatemala and had forcefully evicted
them from it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That the Tiltons had forcefully evicted the De Mohrenschildts
from the Tilton home in Guatemala?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No; it isn't the Tiltons' home in Guatemala. It was a friend of
the Tiltons. I don't remember their names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, who was evicted? The De Mohrenschildts or the people
who owned the house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. The De Mohrenschildts were evicted when the people who owned
it returned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In other words, you gather from that that they had not had
advance permission to occupy that home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That's right. They had not had advance permission and had
occupied it for a period of about 3 weeks&mdash;as best the people who evicted them
could determine from what was eaten <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In other words, they were trespassing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>(Off the record discussion follows.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are basing your comment with respect to the De Mohrenschildts'
possible involvement, if there was any involvement by anyone else with
Oswald which you have already stated and you are stating the reasons why.
And you have related the walking trip down through Mexico to the tip of South
America. This was at the time of the training of Cuban refugees for a possible
invasion of Cuba. And it was during the period of time in which you were
married to the De Mohrenschildts' daughter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And now you have made a remark that we didn't quite get.
What was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Are you speaking of what I said off the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I summed it up by saying that&mdash;uh&mdash;there was an indication
here that they had been in an area where some spying or information-gathering
might be valuable to Communist interests. They had expressed a desire to live
in a Communist country; and that they had traveled extensively through
Communist countries.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What countries?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Poland and Hungary&mdash;no; I'm sorry. Poland and Czechoslovakia.
And Mr. De Mohrenschildt told me one time that he had met Marshal
Tito.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In Yugoslavia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did they make any trips to Europe during the period that
you were married to their daughter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No; they did not. These trips were prior to our marriage.
However, I had seen photographs and had some pointed out to me in the family
album&mdash;photographs of them in various Communist countries.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. Where does your former wife, Alexandra, now live&mdash;if
you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. In Wingdale, N.Y.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is she married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What's her husband's name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. Gibson. I only know him as Don Gibson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What business is he in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. I do not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where does Christiana reside&mdash;if you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. To my knowledge, they have not had a fixed residence since they
married. My last communication from the De Mohrenschildts said that they
were on their way to Europe and I don't know anything other than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Is there anything in addition to what you have already
said that you would like to add to the record that you think might be helpful to
the Commission&mdash;that would open avenues for further investigation or give us
directly information that might be helpful?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We have been off the record once or twice, Mr. Taylor. Is there
anything that you now can recall that you related to me off the record that is
pertinent here or, at least, that you might think is pertinent, that I have failed
to bring out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No; there is nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there anything that was stated in your off the record statements
that you regard as inconsistent with any statement you said on the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, you have the right to read this deposition if you
wish. It will be ready sometime next week. You may communicate with me or
Mr. Barefoot Sanders, the U.S. attorney, and come in and read it and make any
corrections, if you think any are warranted, make any additions if you think
any are warranted, and sign it if you desire and prefer to sign it. You have all
of those rights. You also have the right to waive that if you see fit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. For the sake of accuracy, I would like to read it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. You call, I would suggest&mdash;this is a rather long
deposition&mdash;about Wednesday of next week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. All right. Barefoot's an old friend. I'll call him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. It's much
longer that I had anticipated&mdash;but you were very helpful and thanks for coming
here despite the inconvenience.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Taylor</span>. That's quite all right. I hope I was of some help.</p>

<h2 id="iam">TESTIMONY OF ILYA A. MAMANTOV</h2>

<p>The testimony of Ilya A. Mamantov was taken at 10 a.m., on March 23, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Messrs. Albert E. Jenner, Jr., and Wesley J. Liebeler,
assistant counsels of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Mamantov, do you solemnly swear that the testimony you
are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Before I examine you, Mr. Mamantov, you are appearing voluntarily
at our request?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You understand, do you, that you are entitled to counsel if you
wish counsel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you don't wish counsel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I don't wish it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you are also entitled to purchase a copy of your transcript
of your testimony at whatever the usual rates the reporters charge and you are
also entitled to read over your testimony if you wish, and to either inspect or
sign it, or you may have the right to waive the signing of your deposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. It doesn't matter&mdash;what the proper procedure is&mdash;I would like
to read those&mdash;it's always possible, because the interpretation of a single word
that would change the meaning by someone is up to you. If you want me to sign,
I'll sign. If you don't, all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's your option&mdash;you may sign it or not, as you see fit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's my option&mdash;all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion between Counsel Jenner and the Witness Mamantov off the
record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the record. If he wishes&mdash;it will be Thursday morning probably&mdash;we
would like to have it ready for you to read over, would that be convenient
for you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If you will come up to this office then, Thursday morning, then
one of the other of us will be here and a transcript of your testimony will be
available to you to peruse if you wish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. My name as you used my name was misspelled&mdash;I don't know
if you want that&mdash;it was misspelled on my letter sent me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When I examine you I will have you spell your name. Go ahead
and spell it for us now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. It's M-a-m-a-n-t-o-v [spelling], it is an "an" and not "en" as
you have it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, give your full name and spell it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I'll give you my full name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And how do you pronounce that full name? I-l-y-e [phonetic
spelling], or I-l-a [phonetic spelling]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I-l-y-a [spelling], A. M-a-m-a-n-t-o-v [spelling], and the address
has been changed in the meantime too&mdash;to 2444 Fairway Circle, Richardson,
Tex., Zip No. 75080, if it is important.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you give your telephone number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. AD-5-28&mdash;2873, it's a new number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Mamantov, the Commission desires to inquire of you because
of your acquaintance with the De Mohrenschildts, and your work with the Dallas
City Police on November 22 and 23.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. The 22d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The 22d only, and you translated for Marina Oswald in that
connection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your acquaintance with the Russian emigre group in the
Dallas-Fort Worth area and especially your acquaintance with Marina to the
extent you had one. You have given your full name and your full address.
What is your business, profession, or occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. A research geologist with Sun Oil Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And how long have you held that position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Since 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is that your profession&mdash;a geologist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And prior to 1952, your employment was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. With the Donnally Geophysical Co. here in Dallas as seismologist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And over what period of time did that work extend?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. It covers 1951, the summer of 1951 until the fall of 1955, when
I took my present job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Let's take one step back&mdash;by whom were you employed, or with
whom were you associated, prior thereto?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Lion Match Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. L-y-o-n [spelling]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. L-i-o-n [spelling] Match Co. in New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In what capacity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. As a production scheduling or scheduler for the machines.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it, then, though, you were a trained geologist, you at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
least at that phase of your career you were not pursuing your profession or
your particular calling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right, because I just came from Europe as a displaced person
and I didn't speak English enough.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, I got back to where I was going to go faster than I
thought.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I'll put it this way&mdash;you want it in details&mdash;my life&mdash;approximately
at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Not in great detail, but start out this way&mdash;I am a native of such
and such country&mdash;and just tell us about yourself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. All right. I am a native of Russia. When I was 7 my
parents came to Latvia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They immigrated to Latvia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right, and there I was raised and educated and I received
my geological education and training. In 1945, excuse me, 1944, we left for
Germany with the retreating German Army and I went to South Germany,
stayed until the American Army moved in Peissenberg, P-e-i-s-s-e-n-b-e-r-g
[spelling], Germany and in August of that year, excuse me, of 1945, we went
to a DP camp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. "DP" meaning displaced persons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Displaced persons camp near Guenzburg, G-u-e-n-z-b-u-r-g
[spelling], Germany.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You say "we", at the time were you married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I, oh, I was married all time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you marry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. 1938.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A native of Latvia or of Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Latvia, and my wife is Latvian&mdash;native Latvian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By the way, what is your age, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. 50 and, so, I am&mdash;my mother-in-law was also with us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who is she&mdash;what is her name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Dorothy Gravitis, G-r-a-v-i-t-i-s [spelling].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is she in this country?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. I'll ask you some more questions about her later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. And her husband was arrested by the Communist in 1941 and
we haven't heard of him since that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You say "arrested by the Communist" do you make a distinction
when you use the word description "Communist" as something different from the
Russians?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Oh, yes; nothing to do with the nation. As you know, Communists
are in Latvia, Communists are in Russia, and Communists are in Germany,
and nothing to do with the nation. I am using this as an occupational
force&mdash;I'll put it this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Or way of government.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And where did you receive your higher education?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. In Riga, R-i-g-a [spelling], Latvia, which is the capital of
Latvia, and the name of the university was the University of Latvia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And have you had graduate school education?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's where I got my graduate school. My degree is approximately
equivalent to a local Ph. D&mdash;it's actually between master's and Ph. D.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you settle in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. In September 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And have you and Mrs. Mamantov resided in Dallas ever since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No; my wife still was in Roswell, N. Mex., at that time and
she moved to Dallas immediately after the Thanksgiving Day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In 1955?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right. You see, we received our citizenship in November of
1955 at Roswell, N. Mex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Both you and your wife?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Whole family, and Mrs. Gravitis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does that include Mrs. Gravitis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any particular reason why you were in Roswell, N. Mex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I was with Donnally Geophysical Co. at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was its main office located there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No; this was the field party. The office is located here in
Dallas and we traveled&mdash;at the start of 1951&mdash;Post, Tex.; Brownfield, Tex.;
Lubbock, Tex.; Hobbs, N. Mex.; Odessa, Tex.; Roswell, N. Mex., and I <span class="locked">left&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think that's enough.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. My family and my wife and I moved to Mississippi for a
month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Still employed by Lion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Still employed by the seising crew which was in Magee, Miss.
From there we moved to Palacious, Tex. From there to Coalgate, Okla.; from
Coalgate, Okla., to Seminole, Tex. My wife quit the company at that time and
went to Roswell to join the family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is your wife a professional person also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. She is not graduated from a law school, but she went quite
a way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She took legal training, training in the law?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right, but she worked as a geologist&mdash;as geological computer
for that particular company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she finish her law work in Europe or here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No; she didn't graduate. The Communists moved in and
our law didn't exist at that time, as well you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For the purpose of the record, I am Albert E. Jenner, and this
gentleman is Jim Liebeler. We are members of the advisory staff of the general
counsel of the President's Assassination Commission, and under the provisions
of Executive Order 11130, dated November 29, 1963, Joint Resolution of Congress
137, and rules procedure adopted by the Commission in conformance with
the Executive order and the joint resolution, we have been authorized to take
the sworn deposition of Mr. Mamantov.</p>

<p>I should also say to you, Mr. Mamantov&mdash;have you had 3-days' notice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes, the Secret Service called me on Friday and on Saturday
I received your letter, which was sent to my old address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, that might not be technically 3-days' notice. You are
entitled under the rules of procedure to the 3-days' notice of the taking of your
deposition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes; Friday, Saturday, Sunday&mdash;I had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are entitled to waive that full 3 days if you desire, and do
you agree to waive it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I mean&mdash;I agree to deposition&mdash;I don't know your legal terms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We've got you into Dallas, now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No; we got to Seminole&mdash;one more place I went from there.
No; two more places&mdash;I went from Seminole to Snyder, Tex., and from
Snyder, Tex., I went for 3 weeks to Forest, Miss., and at that time I quit the
company and got my job with Sun Oil Co. here in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With Sun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right; and purchased our home at 6911 East Mockingbird
in October, the 1st of October 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, what is your facility in the command of the Russian
language, with particular reference to&mdash;did you or have you done any teaching
of the language?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes; I am teaching since 1960 here in the Dallas area. I
taught scientific research to some men, of a research personnel in 1960&ndash;1961.
And, I taught in the Austin College in Sherman from&mdash;it was the fall of,
yes, it was fall of 1961 and 1962. No&mdash;1962 and 1963. Now, I am teaching
at SMU or Dallas College, to be specific, of SMU.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you done any interpreting or translating?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes, sir; for the American Geophysical Union, quite extensively
in 1959, 1960, and 1961, and I think&mdash;yes&mdash;1961 I finished.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And have you also done any interpreting or translating for any
law enforcement agencies?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Here in the States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Let me think a little&mdash;no, I don't remember. I have translated
minor papers, you see, like Soviet Union's marriage certificates and
birth certificates for our local courts connected with divorces, and I might
be of a help to a group of Latvians, people here in town, when they received
their citizenship, so much, but this is the first time for the police department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. I'll get to that. Have you ever been called upon by
either any agency of the Government of the United States or of the State of
Texas or the City of Dallas to do any interpreting or translating?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes, I was called by the police force for the City of Dallas
around 5 o'clock, November 22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Of 1955, on 2 or 3 minutes' notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was 1955 or 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Excuse me, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I got from what you have said, then, you had no prior notice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No; sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were called by some official of the city police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes; I was called by Lt. Lumpkin. I think he's Lieutenant&mdash;they
call him Chief.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you repaired then to the Dallas City Police Station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Excuse me, I was called by somebody else, a couple of
minutes ahead of Lumpkin&mdash;is it important?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I don't know&mdash;you might state what it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. All right. I was called by Mr. Jack Chrichton, C-h-r-i-c-h-t-o-n
(spelling)&mdash;I don't know how to spell his name right now, but I guess it is
that, but I can find out in a day or two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And who is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. He is a petroleum independent operator, and if I'm not
mistaken, he is connected with the Army Reserve, Intelligence Service. And,
he asked me if I would translate for the police department and then immediately
Mr. Lumpkin called me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, that was your <span class="locked">first&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. This was a period of five minutes, I would say, maximum.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This, then, was your first contact with or connection with this
tragedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you then came to the Dallas City Police Department, did
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right. However, I called FBI about half an hour before
the police called me. You see, I was in the dentist's office when I heard Lee
Oswald's name, and when this name appeared on the radio, I felt it is my
duty to notify the FBI that I know of him and knew fairly well his background
here in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you so advised the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was a half hour ahead of the <span class="locked">time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. This was approximately, I would <span class="locked">say&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 4:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. 4:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I'll get into that background in a little while, Mr. Mamantov.
You did go, then, to the Dallas City Police Station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. They sent a police car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To pick you up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. To pick me up&mdash;it was quite disturbing because there was
sirens and red lights and the neighborhood was quite disturbed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where did you reside at that time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. 6911 East Mockingbird.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. East Mockingbird?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. East Mockingbird Lane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's correct. And you were escorted into the Dallas City
Police Station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct and was introduced to Captain Fritz.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Go right ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. He took me into a room filled up with the detectives&mdash;before
we entered that room, I had to pass through the hallway filled up with the
newspaper and TV and people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You just went through that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I mean, I just went through with Captain Fritz there that
I saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you got into the room, now, whom did you see there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. When I got into the room I saw Marina, I saw Mrs. Paine,
whom I knew, who has been once in our house, and I have numerous telephone
conversations with her in regard to her learning Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does Mrs. Gravitis live with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you say "our house," that's the house in which you, your
wife and Mrs. Gravitis reside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct. She resides with us since 1943&mdash;we never
were separated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is her first name Dorothy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Dorothy, and I saw Mrs. Paine and I saw next to her a young
woman with a young baby whom I assumed to be Marina Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you ever seen Marina Oswald in your life prior to that
moment? Knowingly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No; sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you ever met her prior to that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, sir; I met her after that, accidentally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No; this is prior&mdash;up to that moment, you had had no contact,
no acquaintance whatsoever with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Nor with Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, sir; but Marina and my mother-in-law had telephone
conversations from my home, so I knew of her quite a bit through Mrs. Paine
and Mrs. Gravitis, but I never had seen her in person, but I never had talked
to her before, so from that room I was taken into another small room, and
after a while Mrs. Paine and Marina was brought in and she also had a baby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And whom else, in addition to you, was in the room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. There was a young detective, I forgot his name. Then, there
was another tall detective who actually questioned Marina and for whom I interpreted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, sir; but if I would see him I would place him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And those were the persons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Well, there was another person, the agent of the FBI, who
was taking notes and sitting across at the desk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is the name "Hosty" familiar to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. It was "H", but I don't remember; but it was, either this
young fellow that was the detective was Hosty, or FBI, but it started with "H".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, it might be "H"&mdash;Hosty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right; and I talked to him after that a few minutes, he will
recognize me and I recognize him when we get together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You seem to be a man who has reasonably good powers of recall;
would you start now, and I will try not to interrupt you, and relate as
best you can recall, and as precisely as you can recall, at least the substance
and the exact words of the questioning and the responses&mdash;the questioning of
Marina and the responses she gave?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. All right. Shall I go ahead?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; just do it the way it comes naturally to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. All right. The problem is, I never tried to memorize this
because&mdash;I mean&mdash;this was pure translation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were probably a little excited then, too, weren't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I was quite excited and I didn't feel like I should try to
memorize it, but she was questioned if she lived at Mrs. Paine's residence in
<span class="locked">Irving&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To which she responded?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. She responded.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did she say? Did she respond in the affirmative, is what
I was getting at?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Oh, yes; she said she was living there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do the best you can, and I'll try not to interrupt you, but I'll
have to, I'm sure, at times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I don't remember the questions, but I would remember approximately
what she was asked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. All right. She was asked if she lived with Mrs. Paine around
that particular day and if she was that morning in Mrs. Paine's home. She answered
positively then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me&mdash;I'm sure that positively is affirmative?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Affirmative.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By the way, as long as we are now interrupted again, what
time was this&mdash;5:30 or 6 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I would say it's 5:30, because going to the police station I
met my wife coming from work, which should be 5:30 or 6 o'clock, I would say.
Then, she was asked if Oswald spent that night in Mrs. Paine's home at that
time, that night from 21 to 22 of November.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The previous evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. The previous evening and including the night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. She affirmed that. Then, how did he get up? She said
he had an alarm clock on and this was the way he got up and he went into
kitchen and supposedly had breakfast. They asked her also if usually she
prepared breakfast for him, and if I remember right, she said usually she
did, but this particular morning she didn't because she was tired and she
had to get up to take care of her baby in an hour or so, so she didn't get up and
he went into the kitchen and was supposed to eat breakfast. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. Was she questioned, or did she say anything about
whether, when he left the bedroom and went into the kitchen to make his
breakfast, whether he returned to her and said goodby to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No; as far as I remember he didn't return. I mean, I don't
think the question was asked to her. Or, it is in my mind that he didn't
return, relating the conversation to that particular time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, Mr. Mamantov, may I say this&mdash;I don't want any
of my questions to induce you to make a response that you don't recall definitely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No; I understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There are bits of information that we have of things we would
like to find out. Do you have a definite recollection that the subject was even
brought up at that time, that is, whether he returned from the kitchen to
the bedroom to say goodby to her before he left or are you refreshing your
memory, is what I am getting at? If you have no recollection, I would prefer
you say so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No; I'll put it this way. I remember conversations somewhere
along the line that he did return to her room. I remember also when
she got up she was wondering that he didn't eat breakfast; apparently coffee
was poured or prepared either by him or by her, which, I don't remember, and
he didn't eat breakfast, and this was after he left, we'll say, a few minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Don't let me interrupt you here before you finish your answers&mdash;do
I gather correctly that what you are saying is that she stated there that
night that she did go out to the kitchen?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That morning&mdash;that she did go out to the kitchen that morning
and she found that he had not prepared any breakfast?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No; I'll put it this way. She apparently slept a little
bit longer after he left, and when she got up and went into the kitchen she
found out he didn't eat breakfast, which was surprising to her. From this
I made my opinion that she usually prepared breakfast for him and she ate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, sir; when you testified a moment ago that she said
she usually prepared breakfast for him, were you then rationalizing from the
circumstance you have just stated, or do you recall that she said that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I understood&mdash;here's my problem&mdash;either I recall or I recall
future instances from translating her life history.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is important, Mr. Mamantov, for you to recall and to exclude
from your mind&mdash;it is very difficult I appreciate&mdash;and to exclude from your mind
what you have learned and to exclude from your mind what you have learned
afterwards; that is, after November 22d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I realize that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What I am trying to get now is exactly to the best of your
powers of recall, what was said on that occasion by her without your rationalizing
from facts you recall as to what she might have said; do you understand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I understand. As far as I know, she said that he didn't
return backward&mdash;I mean&mdash;come back to her&mdash;she didn't get up at the time
he was leaving. After a while she got up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me; now, as a result of this further questioning it is
your present recollection that at the time you were doing the translating
<span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At the city police station, that she said was that he left the bedroom
to make breakfast for himself, that he did not return to the bedroom, and
she, because of being up during the night to care for the baby, she went back
to rest or sleep and got up later on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she say that she then went into the kitchen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did she say what she found when she reached the kitchen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. She found that the coffee wasn't&mdash;I mean, or, she thought he
didn't eat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He had not prepared breakfast, in fact?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Then, I also remember her saying, but I don't remember how
the question was put to her, that she went into the garage to check her belongings
which were stored in the garage, Mrs. Paine's garage, and she saw a grey
blanket which appeared to her in a little bit different position than she remember
it before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she describe the configuration, shape&mdash;form of the blanket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's what I'm saying&mdash;I'll come to it. Then she was asked
what was in that blanket before, why did she pay attention particularly to the
blanket. She said he kept his gun in that blanket. Now, she also said&mdash;she
was asked if she would remember the gun, how it looked, she said, "Probably&mdash;yes,"
she has seen not the whole gun but she has seen part of the gun wrapped
in that grey blanket and at this moment the gun was brought in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, she volunteered that when she got up and went to
the kitchen, noticed that Oswald had not prepared any <span class="locked">breakfast&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She then went to the garage; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct, or she was led to that question, if she had
gone to the garage, and she said continuously that "I went." I assume that
she was led to that question when she stated that she went to the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. After she had inspected the kitchen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she say whether Mrs. Paine was up and about at that time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No; I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't remember anything about Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. You see, Mrs. Paine also gave a statement later on after Marina
finished.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Let's stick with Marina for the moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct, otherwise I would be confused.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she say why she went to the garage or was she asked, and did
she respond on that subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. To the best of my memory, she was asked and led to that
question, if she had gone to the garage, if she had seen a <span class="locked">blanket&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, sir; they could be asking her, in connection with
the questions, to see whether she went to the blanket later in the day. Do you
recall that the question&mdash;is it because of the questioning, or she voluntarily
<span class="locked">stated&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No; because of the question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Because of the questioning, that after she was in the kitchen
that morning, at that time she then went into the garage for the purpose of
examining the blanket and its contents? Just relax and think about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I'm afraid I wouldn't remember in such extent, if she went
immediately or she went later or she went during the time when police was
at Mrs. Paine's home, and I imagine those points are very important to you, and
I don't remember at the moment, I mean, to the exact time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; they are important&mdash;you see, your responses when you first
approached this subject, the implication was she looked at the kitchen, and that
she went immediately out into the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No; I'm afraid I cannot state positively whether she went
during the day or whether she went immediately from the kitchen&mdash;I do not
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You cannot state it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does your recollection serve you that she went before noontime?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No; I cannot state.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or that she went out to the garage at any time before the police
arrived, which was in midafternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That, I don't remember. I do remember that she was asked
about blanket, if she has seen blanket, and she has seen blanket in a very
unusual, or she said in unusual shape as she said she has seen before, about
2 weeks. I remember her mentioning about 2 weeks to the questioning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you mean by that, sir, that the shape and form of the blanket
when she saw it that day was different from the shape and configuration when
she had seen the blanket prior thereto?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. About 2 weeks&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your answer was "yes?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes; it was in different shape than she had seen before. After
that the question was asked what was in this blanket. She said it was his gun,
she was asked when did he purchase the gun, where did he get this gun, and
she stated she didn't know and also probably he would bring the gun from the
Soviet Union, and also was asked the question if she would recognize the gun
if the gun would be shown to her, and at this moment the gun was brought in.
Let me try to remember a little bit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In her responses to the questioning, did she say whether or not
she had been aware of the presence of the gun and the blanket in the garage
prior to November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. This question was asked her. And, she gave a little bit
evasive answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You tell us what she said rather than you giving your opinion
as to whether it was evasive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Oh, if I remember right, she said she didn't know if it were
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She did not <span class="locked">know&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That it was there on that particular morning; however, she
has seen in the past, well, she thought, if I remember right, that Lee took with
him the gun and she was also <span class="locked">asked&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, she testified or she stated in your presence and you
translated it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That she was aware of the fact that the gun had been in the
blanket in the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct, sometime in the past.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; did she say whether she had seen the gun in the blanket
in the garage prior to November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. If I remember right&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she describe what she had seen in the blanket when she
had discovered it prior to November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us what she said in that regard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. She saw the stock of the gun, which was dark brown&mdash;black,
she said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. These were responses of hers before the weapon was brought
in the room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I want to stick to that period, before the weapon was actually
brought into the room, and state what she said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. They asked her also at that time when did he purchase the
gun and such as where. If I remember right, she said she didn't know, she
stated also that he had had a gun in the Soviet Union. They asked her a
question if it was a dark brown or black gun. She said, "Yes, it was the same
color," and she said, "to me all guns are the same color," and then she was
asked if she would recognize a gun if shown to her, and at that time the gun
was brought in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Let's not go to that subject at the moment. I want to go back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did she say, if anything, as to what she saw or discovered
when she went into the garage that morning, the morning of November 22,
to examine the blanket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No; here, I cannot state exactly if it was morning, noon or
time police arrived, when she saw the blanket without the gun, and this&mdash;I
don't remember&mdash;here is my time lapse&mdash;whenever she saw it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But whenever she responded, whenever she saw it that day, what
did she say as to what the package contained, if anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. The blanket was, I'll put it this way, different position as she
has seen in the past.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean in a different position, in a different place in the
garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No; it was supposedly in the same place, but there wasn't
anything in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean it was in a different shape or form or condition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I'll put it this way&mdash;condition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she say what the different condition was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I don't remember, but that attracted her attention. This I
remember very well. She stated it attracted her attention&mdash;as she had seen
before, so much I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Her attention was arrested by the fact that the condition, shape,
form or configuration of the blanket package was different from what she had
noticed it to have been in on prior occasions when she had seen it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Evidently&mdash;if somebody, for instance, if you see a package in
one shape and at different times, you see different shape.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she describe the shape and form and condition of the package
as she saw it prior to this particular occasion on November 22, what it looked
like earlier, and then contrasting that with what it looked like on the occasion
of November 22 when she saw it again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. If I remember right, going back, she had seen the package of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
elongated form and for some reason she opened it and saw a gun, and knowing
it was Lee's, at least a gun, and he didn't want her to touch his things, he was
very particular, and after she opened a corner, she left it in same shape she
had found it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she say whether she had pulled the gun entirely out of the
package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just the butt end?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Just the stock end and she covered immediately and back so
as a result, she&mdash;she didn't pull out all&mdash;she didn't open the package.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did they question her as to where the package was in the garage,
precisely, on the two occasions, that is, when she had seen it before November 22
and the position it was located in in the garage when she saw it on November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. The question was asked and she answered, it was with her
belongings which she couldn't bring into Mrs. Paine's home, and if I remember
right, she said it was in one corner of the garage, and that particular day the
blanket was in the same area, but was in a different shape or in a different
condition. What it was, I don't know. It was in the garage in one of the
corners.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did she say as to the difference and the content?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. She said when she saw the blanket it didn't contain the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It did not contain the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. It did not contain the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she say anything about whether the blanket's form or
condition was, for purposes of illustration not for the purpose of placing words
in your mouth, that the blanket was absolutely flat when she saw it on the
22d, whereas, prior thereto it appeared to contain what she discovered was
a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she say anything about whether the package, the blanket
package, was wrapped in any fashion, with string or any other wrapping of that
character?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that subject brought up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At any time during the questioning was the blanket package
brought into the room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was anything said when she was asked about her entry into
the garage and her examination of the package as to whether anybody was
with her when she did that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I think&mdash;was police and Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At the time that she examined the blanket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Once for sure&mdash;I don't know what happened before that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was she asked whether she had examined the blanket that day
at any time prior to her examination of the blanket in the presence of Mrs.
Paine and the police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you do recall that she did testify or relate as to the incident
you now have in mind that Mrs. Paine was present and the police were present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. On one occasion; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is that the only occasion she was examined about, that is,
her having entered the garage once and then only in the presence of the police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. This, I don't know for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It might have been that she testified to having gone to the garage
on two occasions that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Sir, I don't remember for sure. I rather wouldn't like, as
you say, to interpret&mdash;I would be very happy to relate everything I know.
If you don't remember, you don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May I emphasize over and over again, Mr. Mamantov, that you
don't tell or say anything other than that which you recall in your mind took
place around 6 o'clock on the 22d.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Well, I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So, let me impel you from any thought I have a desire for you
to testify one way or the other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Because I don't&mdash;all I want you to do is to tell, as best you can,
your recollection of what took place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No; I don't remember if she stated this or she didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I do want to ask you this&mdash;you don't want to exclude by this
testimony the possibility that she did, that is, that she testified or might have
said at that time that she had entered the garage on an earlier occasion sometime
during the day, that is, prior to the time the police arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No; I don't want to exclude it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You just don't have enough recollection at the moment to testify
one way or the other on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I noticed that you did say that Marina related the fact
that she had seen the rifle in a disassembled condition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No; I didn't say so. I said, "Elongated package&mdash;she saw
an elongated package," but I don't recall the size of the package, the size of the
package she testified it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think you did testify earlier that Marina remarked that she
had seen the gun in sections?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, sir; you can read it back&mdash;I haven't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion between Counsel Jenner and the Witness Mamantov off the
record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, sir; you asked me the shape of the package she saw,
and I related to you an elongated package and she opened one corner and she
saw the stock of the gun so much&mdash;that I said&mdash;there&mdash;so much&mdash;you asked me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It's important, Miss Oliver, let's go back just so we will be certain
of it and see if we can find it.</p>

<p>(At this point at the request of Counsel Jenner the reporter referred to
previous testimony of the Witness Mamantov and reread the following:</p>

<p>("No, put it this way. I remember conversations somewhere along the line
that he didn't return to her room. I remember also when she got up she was
wondering that he didn't eat breakfast, apparently coffee was poured or prepared
either by him or by her, which, I don't remember, and he didn't eat
breakfast and this was after he left, we'll say, a few minutes.")</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When the question was put to her as to why she went to the
garage to examine the package and what motivated her in that direction, what
did she say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That, I don't remember. That is again coming to the point&mdash;I
don't remember what time she saw&mdash;either she saw by herself or she saw
during the time when police arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But, in either event, whether she went there on her own prior
to the time the police arrived and then again, if that's the way it was, when
the police did arrive, what did she say when, as you have testified, she was
asked why she went to the garage to examine the package, if she said anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes. When police arrived they asked her specific questions
about particular blanket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What questions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. If the blanket was in the shape she saw today in relation
to the shape she saw last time. She said, "No, it has different shape."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Mamantov, did the police ask her right off the bat whether
the package in the garage, the blanket package in the garage, had a different
configuration, or did they first question her, for example, as to whether her
husband owned a gun and whether she was aware of the fact that he did own
a gun and whether she was aware of the fact the gun was in or about the
premises of the Paine's&mdash;what was the sequence, as you recall?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. She was asked if she knew that the gun was at the premises
of Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The questioning, then, assumed that there was a gun, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct. She was asked whether this gun&mdash;when at the
Paines, whether she knew where the gun used to be, and then she said she
hadn't seen gun since the gun&mdash;she saw last time&mdash;and this particular day
when gun wasn't there. No; she never stated, and I don't think she was asked
if she knew that the gun was there that particular morning. That, I don't
know, but she was asked if she knew that the gun was with her belongings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Prior to November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Prior to November 22&mdash;that's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And her response was in the affirmative?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your distinct recollection is that the blanket was not
brought into the room at any time while you were there to exhibit to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Only physical item was gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your recollection is that it is true that the blanket was not
brought into the room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct, the only physical item was brought in, was
the gun itself, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was the gun when brought in fully assembled?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did it have the telescopic sight on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did it have a sling, a leather sling, do you know what I
mean by a sling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes; I know what you mean, but I don't remember right
now. I think it did, but I wouldn't be for sure&mdash;I wouldn't be sure of the
statement.</p>

<p>Now, I don't know if it is important to you or not, she also stated when she
was questioned before&mdash;where he purchased the gun, and if it was a gun which
he had in the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what was her response?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Her response was that it is possible that this is the gun
which he had in the Soviet Union. She cannot say one way or the other if
this is a different gun or which he had before. Now, no person had a gun in
the Soviet Union&mdash;I can say so much for sure and that's where I didn't like
this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No; you just interjected your own observation, that is, no
person had a gun in the Soviet Union&mdash;that was an observation on your part,
not what she said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, no; that's my observation, but maybe not to be&mdash;not
to put it into the record, but I think it is very important when she went back&mdash;when
she said that the gun was brought in from the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Might have been?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. It might have been&mdash;so, she didn't know. The question
was asked when did he purchase, when and where he purchased it and she
said, "I don't know. He had always guns. He always played with guns even
in the Soviet Union. He had the gun and I don't know which gun was this."
And she was asked a question if she would recognize the gun&mdash;she was asked
the color of the gun, if this was the same gun or resembled the gun which he
had in the Soviet Union. She said, to her all guns are dark and black and
that's all&mdash;so much she said about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Before we get to the gun itself, I would like to ask you some
more questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Before we get to the gun itself&mdash;all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it from your answers that she either said or implied
that when they were in Fort Worth, when they were in New Orleans, that he
had the gun that she had in mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. This particular gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whatever gun she had in mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. She made statement this way: She said he always had guns,
he always was interested in guns&mdash;this statement she made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he always had a weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct, he always had a weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she say anything about a pistol as distinguished from a
rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I don't remember the question and I don't remember a reply.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, when she was asked whether she examined the package
on that day, was she then asked to state what she did in the examination of
the package and what she found&mdash;would you state as chronologically as you
can? Did she say, and this is a hypothetic, now, on my part&mdash;"I went into the
garage, I looked for the blanket package, I saw the blanket package, I walked
over to the blanket package, I stepped on it, or I lifted it up, or I opened it
up"&mdash;was she questioned that closely?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I don't remember, questions like you stated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was she questioned about whether she looked for or whether
there was any other weapon different from or in addition to the weapon in the
blanket package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I don't remember the question&mdash;neither question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it fair to say that your best recollection is that she was not
examined on that subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I would say so&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At any time during this questioning was she asked whether she
had seen her husband handle the weapon, that is, that the weapon she saw
with him in his possession&mdash;unwrapped?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, I don't remember, I don't think the question was asked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was she asked whether she knew of her knowledge or information
with respect to her husband's use of a rifle&mdash;whether it was a rifle, a pistol,
or otherwise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes; she stated that he liked to hunt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, was she asked whether he hunted in Russia when he was
in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Oh, yes. She made statement that he also was hunting in
Russia and supposedly was hunting here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She did say that her impression was that he hunted here in the
United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I'll put it this way&mdash;she said he was using his guns for hunting.
She didn't say specifically which, but she said that he used to hunt in
Russia but she didn't say specifically he hunted here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She did not say that he hunted in the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From the evidence, they came over to this country in June 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No&mdash;the question was asked if he hunted here or not and reply
to why did he have the gun&mdash;because she said he had hunted in Russia, he
always liked guns, he always played with the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was she questioned at all on the subject whether he had hunted
with this rifle or any other gun in the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Not in my presence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was she questioned on the subject of whether she had seen
him or was aware of the fact, if it be the fact, that he occasionally or on one or
more occasions had the gun, say, out in the yard of their home in New Orleans
or out in the yard or courtyard in Fort Worth, sighting it and pulling the
trigger&mdash;dry sighting; do you know what dry sighting is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right&mdash;no, she wasn't asked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was she asked in your presence whether there was an incident
in which there was an attempt on the life of General Walker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Nothing about that at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Nothing about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In other words, at the risk of boring you and the reporter,
she was not questioned on this information when you were doing the translating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
or interpreting about any use of the rifle by him, dry sighting, hunting, or
otherwise in the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, not specifically, but this rifle&mdash;I'll put it this way&mdash;about
her seeing him with a weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Any weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, now, have you told us everything you can recall about
the questions and answers and interplay up to the time the rifle was brought
into the room? Is there anything else&mdash;don't be concerned about whether you
think it is relative or not, anything that she said on this occasion is relevant to
us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I understand and I am trying to recollect. No, I remember&mdash;I
think I said everything I could remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have now exhausted your recollection as to everything that
was said at least in substance, and to the extent of the recall of each of the
particulars up to this moment, that is to the moment when the gun was brought
into the room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By the way, was there a court reporter present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. If I remember right, the detective took down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Made notes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Made some notes, and which were read to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Eventually&mdash;that is, at the conclusion of the examination he
summarized his notes in her presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, he read word by word, I translated back. He didn't write
in shorthand, but he wrote it, I remember very well&mdash;Mrs. Paine tried to correct
his English and, of course, minor mistakes. I probably wouldn't write the same
way&mdash;you don't expect every policeman to write the same English, and which
the question was whether "I" or "me"&mdash;that's the mistake it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, when that summary was given by the officer in the presence
of Marina, did she affirm that it was at least in substance correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. She signed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you seek to correct anything in the statement read to
Marina by the officer, that is, did you call attention to anything you thought
had been left out or anything that had not been fairly stated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, they read back to her, I translated back into Russian and
she agreed. Only, there was Mrs. Paine&mdash;Mrs. Paine made a remark about
the grammar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I think&mdash;let's go ahead&mdash;the weapon is brought in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is fully assembled?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. It is fully assembled.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It has a telescopic sight on it and the leather sling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Captain Fritz brought it in and was holding it in his two
hands, with two or three fingers, not to touch gun around&mdash;in that position
(indicating).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Holding it up&mdash;holding it like that (indicating)?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. More or less&mdash;you see&mdash;inclined in that position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Holding it up horizontally or close to the horizontal?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct, and it was brought close enough to her to
examine. She was specifically asked if this was the gun she had seen in the
past in that blanket. She said, "I don't know. All guns to me are the same,
are a dark brown or black."</p>

<p>He asked her again&mdash;"This," which was to me very dark or black colored.
He said, "Is this what you see?" She said, "No, I don't know. I saw the gun&mdash;I
saw a gun;" she said again, "All guns are the same to me." Then they asked
her about a sight on the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. S-i-g-h-t [spelling]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes; a telescope&mdash;she said, "No; I never have seen gun
like that in his possession," and she referred back again to the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did she say to you&mdash;is this a conclusion on your part that
she referred back to the Soviet Union?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No&mdash;no&mdash;she said this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It isn't a conclusion, if you put the words in her mouth, so you
can go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, she said the gun which he had in the Soviet Union, she
didn't know how to say&mdash;she said, "This thing."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The telescopic sight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. The telescopic sight&mdash;she pointed to it with her finger.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, did she say that the rifle or weapon, whatever it
was he had in the Soviet Union&mdash;her recollection was it did not have a telescopic
sight on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct. She was asked if she had seen this part
of the gun which he had in the garage in the blanket&mdash;this she said again&mdash;she
said, "No; I have only seen one part of the gun, which was the end of the
gun"&mdash;which part they asked her&mdash;I think I am calling <span class="locked">it&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The stock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. She pointed to the stock&mdash;correct&mdash;and then she was asked
about the gun again and she said, "Dark brown-black."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Still referring to the stock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Still referring to the stock, and then they asked her for a
couple more questions, if she saw this particular gun in his possession. She
insisted that to her all guns are the same and she couldn't distinguish this gun
from any other gun that he had in the past.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In other words, it is your recollection that they questioned her
very closely in an effort to elicit from her, if it weren't a fact that the weapon
they were showing her was the weapon she had seen, and her responses consistently
were&mdash;they were, no matter how close or vigorous the examination,
that all guns are alike to her, that the only thing she ever saw was the stock of
the gun in the blanket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And her recollection was it was dark brown, and that's all she
thought, to fairly summarize?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct. They asked her again, "Is this the color
you saw?" She said "Yes&mdash;yes, it reminds me of the same color." They particularly
questioned her fairly close, if this was the same gun which belonged
to him and she only insisted she saw the stock of the gun and hasn't seen the
whole gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. And they asked her, I think they came back again and asked
her if she has seen him carrying something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Carrying something?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Carrying something, and she said, "No," she didn't see him
leaving, so she didn't know if he was carrying something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean they came back and asked her whether, when he
left that morning he was carrying anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And her response was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. She didn't see him leaving or walking out of the house,
or whatever he was taking&mdash;means of transportation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She didn't see him leave, so she doesn't know whether he had
anything with him or not, is that a fair statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that a fair statement of her statements?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's exactly right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did they question her as to the details of his coming to Irving,
Tex., the night before, and what did he bring with him, if anything, and
what did he say as to why he was returning on Thursday night, whereas, he
usually came on weekends, as on a Friday, did they go through that previous
evening with her in detail and from point to point so that they could exhaust
the movements of Lee Oswald that previous evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No; if I remember right, they didn't question her to the
extent of his arrival&mdash;well, I don't remember.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They concentrated on his presence the following morning and
what occurred from the time she awakened until the time he left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. To me as a layman, the whole talk was around him having
the gun, and "this is the gun he used."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your best recollection, you recall, is that there was no questioning
of her with respect to movements of this man the previous evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, sir; I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, any questions as to why he came home on Thursday rather
than on Friday as usual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, sir; I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did they go into any questions with respect to the acquaintances
of the Oswalds with people here in Dallas or in Irving or in Fort Worth or in
New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. At that particular time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Over what period of time did this examination take place?
What was its duration?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Roughly, I would say about 2½ to 3 hours. You see, Mrs.
Paine also testified, she was present so they took two statements&mdash;from both of
them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They took Mrs. Paine's and then they took Marina's?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. First Marina's and then Mrs. Paine's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was Mrs. Paine's statement taken in Marina's presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Marina's statement was taken in Mrs. Paine's presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you interpret from English into Russian the statements
made by Mrs. Paine that is, did you translate Mrs. Paine's statement, as she
made it and the questions put to Mrs. Paine, for the benefit of Marina, so
that she would understand the questions to Mrs. Paine and Mrs. Paine's responses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, sir; the statement was not translated into Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you can see why that is important to me, as to whether
Marina would take exception to anything Mrs. Paine said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right. Now, we were waiting about 2½ or 3 hours altogether
for the typist to type that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was the taking of the statement, the transcribing of the
statement, the reading of the statement to Marina and Mrs. Paine, and then
have the witnesses read the statements or listen to them and then sign them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All of this took about 3 hours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Mrs. Paine speak to Marina in Russian while you were
present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right, yes, she did. Mrs. Paine spoke in Russian to Marina&mdash;yes,
she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any statements made by Mrs. Paine in Russian to Marina, were
they pertinent to the subject matters about which you have testified?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No; I don't think so. I don't remember&mdash;personal conversation
more or less about the child who was present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The conversations between Mrs. Paine and Marina in Russian,
were they conversations related to personal matters&mdash;the children?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. The children; and only on one occasion I remember was to
her protection&mdash;Marina's protection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. "What are they going to do with me now?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who made that statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Marina asked of Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. "What are they going to do with me now?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. What are they going to do with me now?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what did Mrs. Paine say?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Well, then, she asked&mdash;are they going to send her back to the
Soviet Union, and Mrs. Paine said, "I don't know," and then she looked at me
and I said, "I don't know either. If you are innocent, then you will be innocent."
I couldn't say one way or the other, and I didn't want to go into conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you say to Marina that, "If you are innocent&mdash;then you are
innocent"&mdash;did you mean to imply by that that she would not be deported in that
event?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right; and then I expressed hope that nothing would happen
to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, have you now told us everything you can recall to the best
of your recollection that was said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. In relation to Marina or to both of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. First, in relation to Marina&mdash;during the course of that 3-hour
meeting or session at the Dallas City Police Station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I think I have told you everything I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In an effort to perhaps refresh your recollection, but without
suggestion that these things actually occurred, was anything asked her about
her relations with her husband, Lee Oswald, whether they got along well, didn't
get along well, whether they had any problems in that connection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I don't think it was brought up at that particular time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have an especial command of the Russian language, you
teach Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And have taught Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have heard Mrs. Paine speak Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please state for the record the extent of Mrs. Paine's
command of the Russian language?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Say for&mdash;I can give only comparison for American person and
for Russian person. I say for an American person&mdash;fair to good for knowledge
of the language, for command of language&mdash;very poor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that the only occasion when you interpreted or translated for
Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. In person? In her presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's the only occasion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see Marina at any time after this incident, this questioning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Intentionally or unintentionally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I think, either way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Either way&mdash;yes, sir&mdash;I once on one Saturday, my mother-in-law
and I went to Sears to Ross Avenue store.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was this some time afterward?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Shortly afterward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How shortly&mdash;the next day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Oh, no&mdash;the next day after Martin, I guess, came into the
picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have occasion to speak with her then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. My mother-in-law went into the main entrance and I opened
the door, and if I remember right, I was holding the door for somebody else to
pass by and mother-in-law got ahead. I closed the door and started to walk off
and catch up and I heard somebody calling, like in my conscious, calling, "Mr.
Mamantov," in Russian and in a very little whisper, and I was walking a
couple of steps further and I heard it again, "Mr. Mamantov," again in Russian
and I turned around and here was a young lady, two children, and about three or
four young men around, so in my mind it occurred&mdash;this is Marina, but I was
so surprised and she didn't look like she looked at the police station. Her hair
became dark and I called out "Netasha," and she called me in Russian and said,
"No, this is Marina." So, I introduced myself immediately to the gentlemen with
her, saying I was translating for her at the police station and my name is so
and so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
In the meantime mother-in-law turned around and started to look for me and
I told her to pass by, don't look, and try to get away, and, I said, "How are you
doing?" She said, "Now is becoming quieter. I am very tired."</p>

<p>That is the extent of our conversation, so we went into basement of Sears
store and when we finished our business, we were going up again&mdash;excuse me&mdash;by
myself. Mother-in-law was waiting for me somewhere&mdash;I had to go and check
on my credit, so after going into the Sears' office, coming back on the escalator,
here was the group again, and I tried to be polite and let her and her escort get
on the escalator, and I stepped on and I told to one, who later I found out was
Martin, and I didn't know at that time who was Martin, and I told him, I said,
"If she needs help in translating the language, please call on me." And so and
so, and that's the time I saw her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that the last time you have seen her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know a gentleman by the name of George De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You do&mdash;when did you first meet him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I don't remember exactly, but let me go back&mdash;are you
through with Mrs. Paine and Mrs. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I'm through with her only if you have told us everything about
this particular occasion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. One occasion they asked Mrs. Paine, and who was also present
and gave us testimony, they asked her if she knew if he had a gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If Mrs. Paine knew?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct&mdash;it's important to you to know this, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. And she said, "No, she didn't." Why didn't she know that
Marina had her belongings in her garage, and she said, "Yes, I knew," and "How
didn't you know that she had a gun," and she said, "Because I didn't go through
her belongings. I mean, it isn't my business to check on what she had there."
Now, they asked her also, knowing that she is a&mdash;what is the religious denomination
in Pennsylvania?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Quaker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Quaker. Would you allow her to have the gun, knowing that
you are Quaker? She said again, "It belongs to her, and it isn't for me to say,"
and this is the extent I remember statements on Mrs. Paine's part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She wasn't asked either about what had occurred the previous
evening; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. You told me to say only what I know&mdash;I know this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I want you to state only what you recall, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I don't remember&mdash;this is overlapping two occasions&mdash;whether
that was that evening, if you will show me the statement that was written, I
will elaborate in details on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion between Counsel Jenner and the witness, Mamantov, off the
record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Back on the record. Are you acquainted with a man by the
name of George De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you first become acquainted with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. If I remember right, in the early part of 1956.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were then a resident of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And will you describe George De Mohrenschildt as to his physical
characteristics first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. A tall, handsome man, well built, very talkative and loud in
society, likes to tell one company jokes&mdash;one sex jokes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He's a hail fellow, well-met type?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Garrulous, talkative?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Very.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Expansive type?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What color is his hair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Brunette with quite a few grey hairs at that time when I
met him, and appealed to ladies and used to take advantage of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Sort of a ladies' man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Sort of a ladies' man, and at that time was married, twice
for sure, and maybe more, and shortly after that had a&mdash;a divorce was pending.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you become acquainted with his then wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, sir; I am acquainted of his girl friend of that general
area, who is now his wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what was her name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I don't <span class="locked">remember&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was she a native born American?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Zhana, I think, probably in English would be Jane, and to
spell Zhana in English translation is Z-h-a-n-a [spelling]. This was the way
she was called in the Russian society.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And translation of that would be Jane in English, you think?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I would say so&mdash;also of Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I was about to ask you&mdash;she was of Russian derivation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was born in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That, I don't know&mdash;I don't know her, as well as I know
George.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was not an American born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I don't think so, but I don't know for sure. I'll put it this
way. She speaks too good Russian to be an American born.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What about De Mohrenschildt in that respect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. He speaks perfect Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is he a native-born American?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, sir; I don't think so, because he was educated in Leige,
Belgium&mdash;well, he finished here&mdash;I know for sure if we meet again, I can
bring you more details from our geological directories, all this information, and
if I remember right, shortly we met him and Zhana together and we had service
in our church, which was very small&mdash;actually was just a regular residence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You told us earlier in the course of our visiting that you participated
in an effort to organize a church here in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. In Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In which you anticipated people of Russian derivation would
be interested?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did that church have a name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Saint Nicholas Eastern Orthodox Church.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Eastern Orthodox Church?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct, and there I saw him and her, I'm talking
about Zhana, very improperly dressed for a church service. If I remember
right, either both of them or she came in shorts toward the end of the service,
which shocked all my family. I mean&mdash;just to describe a man this <span class="locked">way&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean this is part of his personality?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right; and every place we met him he was talking to ladies
elder than he, in a way normally a well brought up person wouldn't do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, what I am trying to have you do is tell us of your acquaintance
with George De Mohrenschildt, and avoiding speculation to the extent you
can&mdash;and the part he played in your life. I am getting at the Russian emigre
group here in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, had you known him prior to the time you met him,
as you have described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No&mdash;no, no; I haven't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or known of him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No; the first time I met him through Mr. Bouhe, and this
was a first acquaintance and just like I said, the only places&mdash;it was in somebody's
house and parties, we usually wouldn't stay too long because of him.
We just have some reason&mdash;we had a tendency to avoid this person as much
as possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You acquired a normal or natural aversion to or dislike of
George De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From what he did and what you thought he represented?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct, because being of the same nationality, I
thought he was hurting all of our emigre here in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know whether Marina or Lee Oswald knew the De
Mohrenschildts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I know that Marina related the conversations to my mother-in-law
as "our best friends in Dallas," referring to both of the De Mohrenschildts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are now stating that your mother-in-law told you that
Marina said to her, "These were their best friends in Dallas"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We both appreciate that that is pure hearsay, but that remark
was made to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I mean, it was made in a family&mdash;after my conversation
between my mother-in-law and Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And there was yourself&mdash;and anybody else <span class="locked">present&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. My wife was present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When your mother-in-law made that statement in your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes; that's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But Marina was not present at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, no; our family haven't seen Marina in our lives. Mother-in-law
never have seen Marina&mdash;was except at a distance at Sears store, except
that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your information is that there never was any direct contact
between your mother-in-law and Marina except on the telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. On telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, was that by way of the telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were not present, in the presence of your mother-in-law,
when your mother-in-law had that conversation with Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, sir; I was at work. You see, she lived&mdash;if I can take
your time, I can tell you how it happened, if it is important I can. I don't want
to take your time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I want to avoid hearsay, and that's why I am going a little
carefully at this moment because, on this trip we plan to talk with your mother-in-law
and take her testimony directly, just not hearsay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's what I thought, but the reason she talked was because
Marina was at Paine's house and Paine went to San Antonio and asked
my mother-in-law to check on Marina because Marina was pregnant at that
time&mdash;you see the connection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No; to check on Marina, that she had any suspicion of her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, no; but in case she needs help, but just in the way
of help, and this way the whole conversation came up. Now, my mother-in-law&mdash;I
asked Mr. Peterson who called me on Friday if my mother-in-law would
be called or is called, I will come with her because she needs a translator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You may bring her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. If I may bring her with me because everything she knows
we know in the family, and she needs a translator, and I translated for her
when she was questioned by FBI. She doesn't speak enough English to answer
your questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, is that so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. She will understand what you are talking about but&mdash;as
far as that&mdash;she is 75, and an elderly lady and she can be quite nervous by being
by herself and so on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, I will attempt my best to put her at ease, which I
have tried to do with you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Oh, I am at ease as much as I can be. I'm trying to be,
because the reasons I hesitate to say&mdash;"Yes, I remember." I don't remember in
some cases, or maybe I remember, like when I translated with Mr. Martin
over here, because in my mind it is very hard to separate right now without
going back and reading the report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you acquainted with a couple, Igor and Natalie Voshinin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They are friends of yours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct; they are also friends of the De Mohrenschildts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And have you had conversations with the Voshinins with respect
to Mr. De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes; and on quite a few occasions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During any of those conversations was any reference made to
a trip that De Mohrenschildt made or might have made to Mexico City, Mexico?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was that trip supposed to have taken place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I don't remember if it was in 1958 or 1959. I don't know.
Mrs. Voshinin can tell you exactly the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, we intend to interrogate them as well. We will leave
it to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right, but I heard from her, I mean, her statement to us was
that De Mohrenschildt went to Mexico and met with the Soviet representatives
and <span class="locked">Mikoyan&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's spelled M-i-k-o-y-a-n [spelling]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes&mdash;who was visiting at that time in Mexico. This, actually,
if you will let me elaborate a little bit more on this&mdash;this mainly was my
opinion of his politics, I mean, I had suspicioned, but this was actually what
led me to believe or doubt his loyalty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you are speaking of De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes, sir; De Mohrenschildt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us your contacts with De Mohrenschildt; do they extend
beyond what you have stated that he participated in the effort to organize the
Eastern Orthodox Church?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, no; he did not participate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He did not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. He did not&mdash;he never was interested in church life, but I
met him through that group, and Mr. Bouhe, who are the most active participants
in organizing the church.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please tell us what other Russian emigres of this
group in Dallas participated in the effort to organize the church about which
you have testified&mdash;yourself, <span class="locked">Bouhe&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No; I joined. This was done already by other people. We
came in 1955&mdash;this already was going for a couple of years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who are reasonably regular attendants or at least persons
interested?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Mr. <span class="locked">Bouhe&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Bouhe, yourself, your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. My wife not so much&mdash;she is a Catholic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. But she attended, and, of course, she did everything for
the sake of her children who are Greek Orthodox, and then Mrs.&mdash;oh, gosh,
what is her name&mdash;Mrs. Zinzade, Z-i-n-z-a-d-e [spelling]. Her first name is
Helen and his name is, I think, George, but I can look in the telephone book
later on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's all right. Are all these people generally Russian intellectuals?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I call you an intellectual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I meant to imply that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Put it this way&mdash;all of them have lower educational level
than I do, except De Mohrenschildt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. De Mohrenschildt has a higher education, as you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Most of these other people have the qualifications or are interested
in what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. De Mohrenschildt has the same or a little bit <span class="locked">low&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As yours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. As mine. We are both geologists and might be called
miners, and the Voshinins are the same.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Grigor'ev&mdash;this was the benefactor of that church. That's
called Grigor'ev, he was the benefactor of that church. Voshinin, Bouhe, all of
us were on the same educational level. The rest of them were below high-school
education, especially like in Mr. Bouhe's case, he is an accountant, and
a Latvian&mdash;Mrs. Grolle, G-r-o-l-l-e [spelling], and the first name is Emma.
Now, who else was there&mdash;now, an Estonian couple who are very active&mdash;Hartens,
H-a-r-t-en-s [spelling], and his first name, I don't remember, but if
you need it exactly, we take the telephone book&mdash;all of these names are in
the telephone book. This group actually was very active in organizing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Meller, M-e-l-l-e-r [spelling]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes; and Mrs. Meller&mdash;right, and the closest relationship is
between her and Mr. Bouhe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean there's a close relation between Mrs. Meller and Mr.
Bouhe, they are close friends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes; closest of all this group because these people actually
was the nucleous of those church workers or financial supporters. I was
a worker for a while, but I didn't contribute money because we just came
to Dallas and we didn't have enough to contribute, but Mr. Grigor'ev and Mr.
Bouhe were the main financial supporters and through them, through all this
group, I met Mr. De Mohrenschildt the first time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then, I'll ask you this general question&mdash;would you please
state all you know about George De Mohrenschildt, and you are free, in making
the statement, to give your impressions and take it as chronologically as you
can, and I should say to you that this testimony is privileged. You are not
subject, unless you have an evil heart and evil intent, to any litigation, that is,
slander, libel, or otherwise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No; only I know about the man, like I told you, that we
were being closer acquainted with him and his present wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Because of his characteristics, of his frivolous life, his
behavior in the presence of ladies&mdash;to us suspicious political trips supposedly
related to his business and this is the extent I can say of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you told us everything you said to the FBI when you
called them on the 22d of November before you were contacted by the Dallas
office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I haven't told them anything except I know of the assassin
and if I can be of service I would like to relate the knowledge I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, was there an occasion on which your mother-in-law, Mrs.
Gravitis made some comment or gave an opinion to you, her opinion as to Lee
Oswald with particular reference to his possible political leanings, and does
that serve to refresh your recollection enough&mdash;I don't want to suggest the
conversation to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. In relation to what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In relation to Oswald, whether he was a Communist or what his
political leanings were in her opinion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Well, on many occasions that came up, the conversation, after
her conversations with Mrs. Paine, and after hearing through Mrs. Paine and my
mother-in-law what he was saying and how he was opposed to our way of life
and knowing that he came from that country, she and I stated that he is a
Communist&mdash;we didn't hesitate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was based upon the reports to you from your mother-in-law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
as to what Mrs. Paine might have or did say to her and from, I gather, your general
knowledge at that time that he had gone from this country to Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And had returned with Marina as his wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct, and not only through Mrs. Paine, because after
we found out&mdash;many people of Russian descent were somehow acquainted with
Lee Oswald and Marina, so we heard later from different sources of him and his
political opinions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, do I correctly interpret your testimony that because there
is a Russian emigre group here that is lively and interested in each other, that
they took an interest, if for no other reason, that they took an interest in Marina
and to an extent, Lee Oswald, to expand her acquaintance in the Dallas-Irving-Fort
Worth area and make them comfortable to the extent that you people out
of the kindness of your heart could do so? I don't want to describe it incorrectly&mdash;give
me your reaction to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. My reaction&mdash;I never was asked to help them, never was
approached by them or people who tried to help them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your impression, that people were trying to help them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. People who tried to help them, I told them on many occasions
they shouldn't do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Well, I told Mrs. Paine&mdash;Mrs. Paine was an interested
person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Because, in my opinion, Oswald was a Communist and was
sent here with certain purpose, whether to kill or what to do, but he had an
assignment and because my belief was and still is, and which is strengthened
due to the 22d assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And these views and opinions of yours are not based on any
direct knowledge on your part of Lee Harvey Oswald, that is, any direct contact
during the course of events up to November 22, that is, you don't point to any
specific knowledge on your part, but it is a <span class="locked">realization&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. It is a realization of what the people told me of his political
viewpoints, their home being in the Soviet Union and supposedly being an undesirable
person, but I have again past cases in my life where exactly what he
did, other people, they are doing it, and I am sure you have heard many questions
on TV and those questions were asked before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And I take it, Mr. Mamantov, that you regard yourself, and that
you are a loyal and dedicated, naturalized American.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you are proud and concerned about your standing in that
respect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes, sir; but I'm not a member of the John Birch Society, I
am not a member of any organization except my professional and local Republican
Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At any time prior to November 1963, were you aware of or has
there come to your attention any information or statement attributed to Oswald,
that to you indicated that he had animosity or opposition to President John F.
Kennedy as an individual, as I say, prior to November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes; I understand&mdash;no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or any animosity or opposition to John F. Kennedy in his
capacity as President of the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, sir; only the information was relayed to me that he was
opposed to the Government of the United States, without mentioning the President
or any other name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have no information on which you personally can rely
of your personal knowledge, indicating that Oswald was a Communist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. You mean if I have proof&mdash;physical proof?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you meet George Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. It is September or, I mean, late part of September or early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
part of October 1955, when I still was by myself in Dallas. I heard of him being
from Estonia, which was mistaken and happened to be a Russian. So I called him
up and we met in the restaurant. He came to my house&mdash;he came to my room
where I rented. I forgot the number&mdash;3405, if I remember right, Milton Street,
and invited me to eat with him out in the restaurant by name Europa, and there
we ate and then somehow we went back, you know, I discovered he is White
Russian and I am White Russian and he talked extensively about Mrs. Meller.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Me-l-l-e-r [spelling]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Mrs. Meller&mdash;right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is she a White Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No; she is&mdash;she came the same way like Mrs. Ford came
from&mdash;was brought by Germans into Germany and came to the States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Off the record a moment, please.</p>

<p>(Discussion between Counsel Jenner and the witness Mamantov off the
record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the record, now. Are you acquainted with what Lee Oswald's
reputation was in the community in which he resided as to his personality?
Now, in this question I seek to distinguish from his political beliefs. What kind
of person was he&mdash;was he quiet, retiring, avoiding friends, did he have any
reputation toward inclination to violence, or did he have a reputation in that
connection, and if so, are you acquainted with his reputation in the community?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I'll put it this way&mdash;the people who wanted to help Marina
didn't want to help Oswald because he was holding back&mdash;I mean&mdash;people tried
to start conversations, always he went into political questions and, of course, immediately
he disagreed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he have a reputation for being unpleasant, pleasant, was he
sociable in the sense that he was at ease among other people, did he seek their
company? I'm asking now, only reputation, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Again, I can say only in the houses he has been&mdash;for one
reason or another he was disliked&mdash;I'll put it this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right&mdash;by the Russian emigre group as a whole?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They had a low opinion of his reputation in the community, in
that community of people&mdash;Mr. Mamantov?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was one of reservation, dislike&mdash;that they did not think well
of his personality?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct, he was holding back and he didn't try to make
friends or he didn't try, was what I heard&mdash;he tried to keep Marina away from
those people and appeared a couple of times with her in other Russian houses,
but not very willingly and was holding back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was holding back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall anything else with respect to his reputation in
the Russian community area? I'm not seeking specific instances, but only general
reputation, the reaction of the Russian community group toward Lee
Harvey Oswald before November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes; once he beat up Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, that's a specific instance, and therefore is not reputation.
May I explain to you that reputation in a community is what the whole body
of the community feels after knowing a person for a while. It is a reaction
gained by people in the community from many instances.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Not from the one instance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But, not from one&mdash;one instance is hearsay to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Well&mdash;only, I know that he was undesirable&mdash;and after people
met him a few times, or, we say, met even once in their own houses, he was
undesirable to those people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he regarded as a difficult person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think you have said this, but may I ask you&mdash;your mother-in-law,
Mrs. Gravitis, has served as a tutor for Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I mean&mdash;she get the job through me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That put her to work with Mrs. Paine. You see, what happened,
Mrs. Paine was calling me at the office and asked to teach&mdash;and I told her
I'm not interested to teach individual students, and I suggested my mother-in-law,
and this way we made arrangement for my mother-in-law to teach her
Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you acquainted with the reputation in the Russian community
of Marina Oswald, and I'm going to ask you several subdivisions&mdash;first,
as to her personality.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. From what I heard, she was a very pleasant young girl, was
quite open in her discussions, in her conversations. My conclusion was that
she is very pleasant to be around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you acquainted with her reputation in the Russian community
for truth and veracity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. For whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As to her truth and veracity, that is, did she have a reputation
with respect to whether she was or was not a truthful person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right, I see what you mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A person upon whose statements one might rely?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I don't know&mdash;as a community. I do know in our family
discussion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I'll take that part of the community.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. All right. We didn't accuse her one way or another way,
but we couldn't understand how she could come out of the Soviet Union so
easily and also, statements she made to my mother-in-law about him living in
a small apartment, which we still have relatives and, I mean distant relatives,
and we know that they cannot live in a comfortable apartment. For this reason,
we have opinion, or, we wouldn't trust her on the first-hand information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she have a reputation in the Russian community with respect
to whether or not she was a member of the Communist Party? Now, that is
a political question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Now, she told my <span class="locked">mother-in-law&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, please, did she have a reputation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Wait just a <span class="locked">second&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A reputation, whether she was or was not&mdash;what did the Russian
community as a whole, now, not just your mother-in-law?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. All right&mdash;you want the Communist Party of the United
States or Communist Party of the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, I'll take both of them&mdash;I'll take the Communist Party
of the Soviet Union first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Everybody knew that she was a member of the Communistic
Youth Organization&mdash;she didn't even hide this, but I never have heard of somebody
implying that she would be a member of the Communist Party of the
United States, so as community, I don't think everybody considered her as well
tied to the Communist Party as the community did Oswald himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the general reputation, if any, of Marina in the Russian
community on the subject of whether she had any fixed political views and might
actively support those views here in the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No; I don't know this&mdash;I mean&mdash;I don't have any opinion.
I haven't heard anything&mdash;I know that she didn't&mdash;she avoided political discussions,
I'll put it this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. She did avoid political discussions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it from your testimony, you are acquainted with the Fords?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think you said Mr. Bouhe was a bachelor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct. He is a bachelor now&mdash;he was married&mdash;he's
divorced.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He's a grass widower?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right, but he was a very short time widower&mdash;he could be
married.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you and your family aware of Bouhe's efforts, if they
were efforts, to collect clothing and otherwise be helpful to the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were aware of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was that in your opinion a good faith, charitable impulse
on his part?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You think it might have been ulterior?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. We objected immediately when we heard about this. We
objected to every person who took Marina in their own house, in trying to
collect money and clothing, and this supposedly happened after her husband
beat her up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When there went through the Russian community a report that
Lee Oswald had inflicted physical violence on Marina, then the community
objected to assistance being afforded the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I don't know&mdash;I think they were especially helping her, after
they left Fort Worth, and they had domestic disagreements. Supposedly, she
was attacked by him&mdash;then the Russian community here in Dallas tried to help
her by taking her into the houses or collecting money and collecting clothing
and stuff like that, so I opposed this more and more violently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you do know that the Russian community, as such, of which
Mr. Bouhe was a member, was seeking to assist her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By collecting clothing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Gathering money and taking her into their homes on occasions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's right&mdash;assigning for certain families to keep for a
couple of weeks or a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That included Mrs. Meller?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That included Mrs. Meller, Fords, and he tried to get this
<span class="locked">person&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you say "he" you mean Mr. Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Mr. Bouhe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He tried to place her with whom&mdash;Mrs. Grolle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes; she's an elderly person and lives by herself and had a
few rooms for rent and as far as I know, she didn't take her into her home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, we have no information that she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. As far as I know, I don't think that she did, but I don't think
that she did, but Mellers and the Fords took her for a week or for 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you ever heard of a Mrs. Elena Hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Elena Hall&mdash;how do you spell it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. H-a-l-l [spelling], E-l-e-n-a [spelling].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No; the first name&mdash;Elena Hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, sir; you see, we have a secretary, Helene, H-e-l-e-n-e
[spelling] Hall, which couldn't be that person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No, that's a different person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Paul Gregory or Peter Gregory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes, sir; father, I think, is Peter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean one is the father and one is son?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. One is father's name and one is son's name&mdash;that's correct,
but his father is not living. Do you know how Russians call your name&mdash;if I
would refer to you, it is your name first and your father's name second, instead
of saying Mr. so and so, so that's how it appears.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What do they say in case&mdash;since my name and my father's name
are the same?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. The same&mdash;it would be, if you are, for instance, Oswald, it
would be Oswald Oswald, each ending implies you are a son of Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have already mentioned Volkmar Schmidt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was a roommate or lived with Mr. Glover.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. And a close friend of Dick Pierce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. P-i-e-r-c-e [spelling]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Also a geologist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or, P-e-a-r-c-e [spelling]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, P-i-e-r-c-e [spelling].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was his first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Richard, R-i-c-h-a-r-d [spelling].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is Mr. Norman Fredricksen a student?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I was teaching scientific Russian for the Socony Mobil Research
Lab in Duncanville, and this student joined. Actually, the class was
carried out first, well, first semester and Mr. Fredricksen was hired by Socony
Mobil and joined the class.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How old a man is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Oh, I would guess around 28 plus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He is a young man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes; he came to&mdash;he served in the Army.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you&mdash;the United States Army?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. United States Army, was in Germany, and studied Russian in
Heidelberg. When he came back, he did graduate work after the Army. He did
graduate work at the University of Pennsylvania and had studied Russian, so
when he came to my class he had a very good background of the Russian language
already.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, there was an occasion, was there not, in which this student,
Norman Fredricksen, said something to you about Oswald; isn't that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. May I point out, I lost him for a while after I finished that
semester, that interrupted Russian, and this was in the spring of 1961, and if I
am right, about a semester or two semesters later, he and Volkmar Schmidt came
to my home and asked me to conduct private lessons for both of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you also been tutoring Volkmar Schmidt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. They came&mdash;right now, they came to my house. Not before&mdash;the
first time I met Volkmar Schmidt was when Fredricksen and Volkmar Schmidt
came to my home, and I said, "All right, I'll take both of you," and I talked
to Fredricksen, and Volkmar Schmidt was described as knowing the same
amount of the Russian language, and I found out he didn't know half as much
as Fredricksen did and I offered to split and I would continue to teach for
the same amount of money Fredricksen, and Volkmar Schmidt would take
from my mother-in-law, who had time and willingness to teach individual
students, so we split&mdash;I was tutoring Fredricksen and she was teaching
Schmidt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did there come this occasion when Fredricksen spoke
to you about the Oswalds one night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's right, and Fredricksen and his wife came to visit
with us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct, and this was, I would say, sometime&mdash;March,
April, might be of 1963, and so they told us yesterday or day before yesterday
that they went to a very interesting party where the person present just came
in from the Soviet Union and his wife, and the party was held at Glover's home.
I asked him who was present. He said Mrs. Paine was present, of course, both
Oswalds were present, and the De Mohrenschildts were present. Of course,
Glover was present and I don't remember who else he mentioned, and we started
the conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was Fredricksen present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right, Fredricksen and his wife, he and my wife, my mother-in-law
and myself violently jumped into the conversation, and I said, "Folks,
you just don't know with whom you are associating. You shouldn't be at that
party, and you shouldn't be going into those houses," and, of course, they said,
"We just wanted to speak Russian. Mrs. Paine wanted to learn Russian, so
we wanted to learn Russian and we just decided to get together and learn
Russian." And they didn't speak Russian very much except with Marina. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
was very shy and didn't talk very much. Most of the evening was spent conversing
with Oswald on political questions, because he understood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was the report they made to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the questioning by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, you
mentioned either a Mr. Clark or a Mrs. Clark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes, those people from Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What are their names&mdash;do you remember a given name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, I don't remember, but he is a lawyer and his wife, she
is a Russian from France. He married her, I think, during the American occupation
of Europe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By the way, Mr. Gregory is a native-born Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes, he is Grigor'er. He has changed his name&mdash;it isn't his
original name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Originally, it was Gregoria and he changed it to Gregory, spelled
G-r-i-g-o-r'e-r [spelling]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. It could be&mdash;he spelled it also with an "e", but that's originally
his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He is a petroleum consultant of some type?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Petroleum engineer&mdash;correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is he part Russian&mdash;part of the Russian emigre group here in
the Dallas-Fort Worth area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's right. You see, we are not meeting with them for
quite a while as a group. We broke away, but individually, I have been with
Gregorys on a few occasions&mdash;I have been with the Clarks on few occasions
together. I have been with Mr. Bouhe quite frequently in the past&mdash;whom
else&mdash;the same I know them very well personally but we didn't meet&mdash;we don't
meet as a group any more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Mamantov, do you have anything that occurs to you that
you think I would like to add to the record that you think might be helpful
to the Presidential investigation of the assassination of President Kennedy,
in connection with its work in investigating the assassination of President John
F. Kennedy; if so, would you please state what you have in mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. I have grave doubts of Marina's exit of the Soviet Union so
easily. Of course, I don't have any proof one way or the other&mdash;but knowing
her life from what I translated, I have more doubt of her arrangement&mdash;how
the woman could come out so easy from the Soviet Union, because if I liked to
get&mdash;if I would have liked to take some of my family out it would take for me
years and thousands of dollars to get my closest relative out of the Soviet Union.
Besides, she should be old, practically as a laborer help not useful to the Soviet
Union, and here, a young lady&mdash;20 or 21, just married an American citizen came
out and&mdash;but I don't want to accuse her&mdash;maybe she's completely innocent. I
know other cases where people would use all possible means to get out of the
Soviet Union. Maybe this is the case, but there is still in my mind quite a doubt
of her coming out so easy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there anything else you want to add?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, not on this particular case, I think that's everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, we have had some off the record discussions and I had a
short talk with you before we began this deposition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there anything that occurred during the course of our off the
record discussions or preliminary talks before the deposition, that you think is
pertinent here that I have failed to bring out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, I think you brought out everything that I think of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there anything you said to me in the off-the-record discussions
or the preliminary discussions which, in your opinion, is inconsistent with
any testimony that you have given on the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, I don't think it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, as you sit there, do you have any feeling that at any time,
on or off the record, that I directly or indirectly sought to influence you in any
statements you might have made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, we very much appreciate your cooperation and help and
in sticking with us now and going into all of this with us, and at the moment, I
don't have in mind anything further, but it is possible that while I am still here
in Dallas this week or next week, or afterwards, I might wish to get in touch
with you and have you further extend your deposition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We will close the taking of the deposition of Mr. Mamantov at
this point.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="mdg">TESTIMONY OF MRS. DOROTHY GRAVITIS</h2>

<p>The testimony of Mrs. Dorothy Gravitis was taken at 1 p.m., on April 6, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W. Belin, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission. Ilya A. Mamantov, interpreter.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I am going to ask you both to stand up. Would you raise your
right hand. Mrs. Gravitis and Mr. Ilya Mamantov, do you solemnly swear,
Mrs. Gravitis that the testimony you are about to give, and Mr. Mamantov, the
translation that you are about to give, will be the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Your name is Mrs. Dorothy Gravitis?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Richardson, Tex., 2444 Fairway Circle (AD 5-2873).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that a suburb of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mrs. Gravitis, is your daughter married to Mr. Mamantov?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you born?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Latvia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. May I ask approximately how old you are?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Seventy-four years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you live in Latvia all your life before coming to America?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. First Latvia was independent. It was part of Russia. I was
born in Latvian territory, which was at that time Russia.</p>

<p>I was educated in Russia, in Moscow.</p>

<p>I was teaching in the Russian territory, and after that in Latvian territory,
before Latvia became independent, in Ventspils, the name of the city where I
was teaching in Latvia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Latvia became independent in 1918?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And remained independent until Russia annexed these three
Baltic countries around 1939, or so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. 1940. In 1913, I got married.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Do you need a very detailed story on her life?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span> [through interpreter]. I lived until 1950 in Ventspils, and
then I and my husband were evacuated to St. Petersburg or Petrograd at that
time. This was in 1915.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now it is Leningrad?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Leningrad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me ask you this. Did you stay in either Russia or Latvia
from that time on until after&mdash;for how long?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. From 1915 to 1919, in Petrograd. Then in 1919 I and my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
daughter came to Latvia. My husband remained in Petrograd. They didn't
let him out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. From 1919 onward, where did you live?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. From that time until 1940, I lived and worked as a teacher
in Latvia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you teach?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. I taught mathematics, approximately the equivalent to junior
high, and the Russian language.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you work for the State or for a private school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. State school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. From 1940, where did you live and what did you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. At that time it became the Soviet Union, part of the Soviet
Union, and I lived in the same spot in Latvia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know the city?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Zilupe, which is about half a mile from the Russian border.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you stay there? From 1940 on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. All the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Until when?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. I worked 1 year under the communistic government as a
teacher until 1941. Then I was teaching under the German occupation as a
teacher until 1943. Then I came to live with Mr. Mamantov in 1943, in Riga,
which is the Latvian Capital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Up to 1940, had your husband left Petrograd to move back to
Latvia with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. When I came with my daughter to Latvia in 1919, I didn't
go back any more, and my husband joined me in February 1923.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And he stayed until how long? Did he stay with you in Latvia
then, and what happened to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. When he came to Latvia, he was a railroad station manager
immediately, or became. And I was a teacher in that town. And we lived
there until 1941, until he was arrested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know what ever became of him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. I don't know. Just recently I received a letter from my sister-in-law
and she said that he died in Siberia and didn't know when.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you leave Latvia, and where did you go?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. 1944, I went to Germany.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You went with your daughter and son-in-law?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Yes; and two children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And your two children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Your two grandchildren?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you stay in Germany?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. In Bavaria.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In a camp?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. No; not immediately. We were all the time together, and
so we came to Bavaria in October 1944, and stayed in private residences until
August 1945, and at that time we went to DP camp near Guenzburg.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you stay in the DP camp? Until when?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Four years in&mdash;until October of 1949, when we went to Bremerhaven
and proceeded to the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. She left 2 weeks ahead of us because her name started with
"G".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you go in the United States when you got here? Where
have you lived since you have come here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. In New York City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you live in New York, and where have you lived
since then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Approximately 1½ or 2. However, we left New York February
28, 1952.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And you came <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. To Post, Tex.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that near Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. 325 miles west of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you stay in Post, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. I am sorry, Brownfield, which is 38 miles north of Post.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where have you lived in Texas since then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Quite a few places, because I don't remember the small towns.
Brownfield, Lubbock, and again Brownfield.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Since you have come to Texas, have you always lived with your
daughter and son-in-law?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span> [to Mr. Mamantov]. So in your deposition, I would assume then,
Mr. Mamantov, what you said, I would find the places you have lived in Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Before coming to Texas, did you do anything in Europe other
than teach? Any occupation other than teaching when you were in Europe?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Before we left Latvia, you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. I was a housewife also. No other profession.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Since coming to America, what has been your occupation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. In New York I was part-time janitor together with Mr. Mamantov,
on Broadway somewhere. Was cleaning the sidewalks and heating the
furnace. The people helped me, the neighbors helped me to clean the sidewalks.</p>

<p>I was raising the grandchildren, and by that time we had three. One was
born in Germany. Then after that I sewed and taught Russian, individual
students.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This is generally what you have done then since coming to Texas,
is private tutoring?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. And sewing. The sewing is the main point, but tutoring on
and off, because it is not enough students.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you first become acquainted with Ruth Paine, Mrs.
Michael Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. I was teaching in Berlitz School here in Dallas. I was
also teaching Mrs. Paine. This was 3 years ago, but I don't remember the date
when I started. And Mrs. Paine used to take Russian instructions at the
Berlitz school, but not from me. I can add this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know how much the Berlitz School of Russian lessons
cost?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. You mean how much I got paid?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. No; how much Mrs. Paine paid?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. I don't know for sure. The principal didn't tell me, but
I heard somewhere from $5 to $6.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is at the Berlitz School?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. He paid me $2.50.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. $2.50 for a private lesson?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Being directly, not through the Berlitz School?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. No; I received remuneration.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The Berlitz School paid you $2.50?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. For how long a teaching session would this be?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. One hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. A private session at the Berlitz School for one hour, or would
this be several people in the class?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. If I had one student, then I received $2.50. If I had two,
then I received $3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you taught Mrs. Paine, was there generally one student?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Excuse me, I never taught Mrs. Paine. Mrs. Paine was taking
lessons before I came to that school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How did you get in contact with Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. I gave two lessons to Mrs. Paine at the Berlitz School. This
way I became acquainted and she said it was too expensive, and Mrs. Paine
dropped out of school.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. After she dropped out, Mrs. Paine called me at the office
and asked me to teach, and I refused, but I suggested my mother-in-law would
teach her at home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At whose home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. At our home. I mean it is a private lesson for $8 per hour,
private lesson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When Mrs. Paine was taking from you those two lessons at the
Berlitz School, was there anyone else in the class with her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. She was by herself and I gave her only two lessons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What kind of student was Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. She was a good student, talented, serious.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had she had any contact with any other Russian teachers, that
you know of, in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Pardon me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Mrs. Paine have any contact with any Russian teachers in
Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What do you know about this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. I was correcting the lessons. I had the letters&mdash;Mrs. Paine
was writing to this particular teacher. The name of this teacher was Nina, and
she was teaching English language, beginning classes. Some were in Russian,
somewhere in Russia. I don't remember the name of the city.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know how Mrs. Paine got in contact with this Russian
teacher?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. I asked her, and as far as I remember, she said through a
youth organization, but she didn't go into detail. I didn't question her any
more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know what the name of the youth organization was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Or was it a political youth organization?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In the letters that you translated or corrected did the grammar
of Mrs. Paine, contain any political discussion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Letters, you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The letters that Mrs. Paine was sending to the teacher, or the
letters you saw from the teacher, was there any political discussion involved?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you first start teaching Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. I started some time during the summer before Mrs. Paine's
son was born, who was born in February, the following February, and then
she discontinued taking lessons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What period would this have been? What year?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Approximately 3 years ago. The boy right now is 3 years old,
so we say 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. 1960, wouldn't it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. The boy was born in 1961. Yes; 1960, the summer of 1960.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. After the boy was born, did you ever give her any more Russian
language lessons?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Yes; during the fall when the boy was a few months old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you keep up contact with Mrs. Paine after she quit taking
lessons?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you first hear or learn about Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Either April or May. Probably April. Mr. and Mrs. Fredricksen
came to our house and told us they had attended a party, that there
was an American who came recently from the Soviet Union, and his wife is a
Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you first have a conversation with Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. I never have talked with her in person, but only on the phone.
In May of that particular year, Mrs. Paine went to San Antonio, and she asked
me would I help Marina because she doesn't know the English language and
nobody could help her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This was Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. She asked me to help, and Marina was pregnant at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me ask you this. Have you ever met Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you ever met, or did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald,
her husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever talk to Lee Harvey Oswald on the telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever talk to Marina Oswald on the telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How many times, approximately, have you talked to Marina
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did the first conversation take place, and what was said?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. The time when Mrs. Paine went to San Antonio, we had a
severe storm, and the next day in the morning, I called Marina at the Paine's
home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This would have been when?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. I think this was in May 1962, or 1963, I forget. This was
this past summer, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did Marina Oswald say? Did she say where she was from
and where she lived before she came to this country?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. I asked her where did she come from, from what city in
Russia. The answer was, she came from Leningrad and used to live in Leningrad,
on Ligovka Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did she say she lived anywhere else other than Leningrad?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. She said she lived in Minsk and got married in Minsk, and
together with her husband&mdash;excuse me it is just the reverse. She lived in
Minsk, got married in Minsk, and went to Leningrad and lived on this street in
Leningrad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. After she was married?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. She lived in Leningrad with her husband after she got married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Would you mind if she started again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let's start at the beginning now.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. In Minsk she got married. This is White Russia. And then
together with her husband arrived at Leningrad. They lived in Leningrad on
this street, Ligovka Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Now mother stresses that so much, because she remembers this
part in Petrograd very well, and this was the laborers, the poor part of Leningrad&mdash;I
mean of Petrograd at that time, and somehow brought mother's memory
back to Petrograd.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did she say what she did in Leningrad and Minsk after she was
married, or what her husband did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. I asked her what is her profession. She said she is a pharmacist.
And I was surprised at 22 years and pharmacist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did she say what her husband did in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. I didn't ask and she didn't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did she say what her father did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. No. She said that she didn't have parents. Father and
mother were dead, and for this reason she had easier time to get out of Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did she have a stepfather?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did she say why she came to the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. She said her husband was returning home and she came
with her husband. I was very surprised how did the Soviet Union let you out,
I asked Marina. She said, "We had a luck."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did she say anything else about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. "Husband doesn't have work here." I mean in the United
States, and so her husband didn't have any income, and for this reason she
lives at Mrs. Paine's home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did she give any other statements about how she happened to get
out of Russia other than that she had luck?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. I didn't ask and I felt she wouldn't tell me. I mean, I didn't
ask, and I feel if I asked, Marina wouldn't tell me. Nobody who is coming out
from there would tell how they got out or why they got out. She was complaining
that her husband didn't have work here and couldn't get a job. I
replied that everybody who wants to work in the United States can get a job.
Then she asked me what kind of work you mean. I said any kind of laboring
work is possible. Roadwork or any kind of work. And she said that her
husband thinks that such type of work is below his dignity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did she say whether or not her husband was a Communist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. She would like to ask you now what do you understand by
the word Communist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, I would like to have your mother-in-law explain just
what she would call it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. I had a conversation. I said here in Dallas is a person or a
gentleman who helps many Russians who are arriving in this city, or who has
helped in the past, Mr. Bouhe. Marina said, "Yes, I know him." She said her
husband and Mr. Bouhe don't match in their characters. And I replied that
you think probably not match the characters, but they agree in their principles,
and she said, "Yes."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. She said, my husband&mdash;and this word, I don't know exactly
how to translate it&mdash;I mistranslated it for the FBI, this word, and I think in your
investigation it is very important.</p>

<p>She replied that her husband is now&mdash;I could not translate just the individual
word. I have to give you the meaning of the Russian word, which
was developed fairly recently&mdash;that my husband is a person who believes in
ideas, and it means ideals of the Communist movement. Now, I can give you
the translation of this word if you would like to insert, because maybe in
Washington you can get a better description of this word.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Can you spell the word?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes; ideinyi&mdash;which has political connotations, and it means
a person who believes in the Communist movement, Communist ideals, but
doesn't hold yet a ticket or membership in the Communist Party. But this is
a step to achieve the membership in the Communist Party.</p>

<p>And I think it is very important, which mother emphasizes, and I translated
it in the FBI report, "idealist," which is not correct. So it is broken down
first, pioneer. Second, the membership in the Youth Communist Party. Third,
the candidate for the Communist Party. And this third step is eventually for
this particular work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. As I understand it now, you say there are various stages to become
a member of the Communist Party in Russia, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. When mother heard this word from Marina, she couldn't
talk to her any more or ask her any questions, because this stage of the person
becoming a full time member Communist was most dangerous for the people
in Russia or in Latvia or in the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What do you mean by most dangerous?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. I mean that this is the most dangerous stage, because this
person or during this stage, they are spying on other people. They are spying
on other people to gain personal reward from the communistic people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In other words, they had to do certain deeds when they go to
the last stage, which is the actual Communist membership, is that it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Yes. I also said in the previous conversation, which I can
assure you that this is true, which I know from my personal experience.
When I was teaching from 1940 until 1941, people like this, who were in this
particular stage, who were not yet members of the Communist Party, were spying
on me, listening behind the door when I was teaching in the class, and this
way it is my experience from that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I believe that she said that a very small percentage of the Russians
are actual members of the Communist Party, and that it is the screening
process that gets memberships, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes. It is a small percent of population are the members,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
are the actual members of the Communist Party, and to become, they have to
gain reward. I mean, they have to be advanced by the individual deed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About what percent are members of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Are you asking her at that time when she left or what it is
now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Both.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. At that time there were approximately 2 million, which is 1
percent, approximately. And I have read recently that there are approximately
5 or more million people members.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. But she doesn't know of her own knowledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. She read. She said that she read recently also that there
are approximately 20 million of the communistic youth members, or members
of the communistic youth organization.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. If you don't belong to that organization, you cannot get
education. You cannot advance in your educational system.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Marina Oswald say whether she was a Communist?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. She said that when she got married she was expelled from
the communistic youth organization, which in Russia is called Komsomol.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did she say why she was expelled?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Because she married an American. I understood that this
was the reason why she was expelled. And I asked how did they allow you
to leave the Soviet Union. When you are expelled, they considered them as
enemies of the people, and they don't give them permission even to work, a
working permit. And they don't give those people also the free education or
scholarship.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you are expelled from the Communist movement, does this
affect whether or not you get out of the country?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. I don't know. I think it wouldn't help.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Marina Oswald say anything else about her husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did she say much about the people that she knew here in
Dallas, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. She said that many Russians helped her and Americans here
in this vicinity helped her. She said that she wouldn't like to meet with the
Russians any more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Because Russians are asking too many questions. I feel that
because she got tired of being questioned all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Marina Oswald say whether or not she would take any work
here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. They haven't talked on this particular subject. However,
mother's interpretation is that she couldn't work because she has a small child.
She talked only about her husband who didn't have work and they didn't have
an automobile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Didn't have an automobile?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did her husband know how to drive?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did she say anything about her husband as a photographer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Yes; he would like to obtain a job as a photographer. And I
understood that he was in Oak Cliff a photographer, and when he went to New
Orleans, he continued to look for a job as a photographer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Marina Oswald say anything about what her husband did or
had done in Russia and where he had gone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. No; only that he was in Minsk and then Leningrad so much.
I didn't ask her any more questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could he travel in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What kind of living accommodations did Lee Harvey Oswald have
in Russia? A house, or an apartment, or what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. She said that in Leningrad they had a room, and she volunteered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
to say that the room was better than the Russian people locally would
have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why was this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Was because her husband was an American.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was it just that he was an American? Did she say, or was it
because he was in this so-called third stage of the&mdash;of becoming a member of
the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did she say anything about whether or not the husband, Lee
Harvey Oswald, had a gun in Russia or whether he went hunting there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. She didn't say anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. I didn't have time to talk. It is my personal opinion, if he is
just an average man in Russia, he wouldn't have any chance to have a gun or
rifle or shotgun in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about to become a member of a hunting club or go hunting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. This is so in America. There is no such thing as hunting clubs
over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You know of no such hunting clubs over there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Of course there are trappers, but either they are professional
trappers or they are members of the communistic party. Otherwise, you have
to have permission to have a firearm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have to be a member of the Communist Party to belong to a
hunting club?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Marina Oswald say anything about ever going for walks to
discuss things so they wouldn't be overheard when they were in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you say that the living accommodations were better because
Lee Harvey Oswald was an American, what do you mean they were better? In
what way would they be better than the average person there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. The room was larger, cleaner, and probably in a better area of
the city. I think, because he would write to his relatives, that he certainly would
say that he had better accommodations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did Marina Oswald say about how she liked the United
States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. She liked the United States and she also said that she was
watching TV that particular day when they talked, and she saw our President
being in the crowd and shaking hands with people. It was unbelievable. She
said it is unbelievable such a freedom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did she say anything about whether she belonged to a church?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. In Russia or in the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Here in the States.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. She didn't say that she belonged to a church, but she did say
that she christened her daughter or she had christened her daughter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And what church?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. The Greek Orthodox. It is called Eastern Orthodox.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Here in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there anything else in this first conversation that you had
with her that she said about her husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. First of all, what struck me was that she said it is below his
dignity to take any kind of work. That surprised me very much. That is my
personal interpretation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. My question is this. Is there anything else that Marina Oswald
said about her husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now did you have any other telephone conversations with Marina
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Two times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Two more?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Twice in total.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Two conversations in total?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, the first one you said was in May of 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When was the second one?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Approximately maybe 2 or 3 weeks. I don't remember exactly
when Mrs. Paine came back from San Antonio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This would be, say, June of 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Approximately. Before she went to New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you ever talked to Marina Oswald since that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you ever talked to Mrs. Paine about either Marina Oswald
or Lee Harvey Oswald since these conversations with Marina Oswald, or about
that time? Have you ever since talked to Mrs. Paine about the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you say, and what did Mrs. Paine say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Mrs. Paine told me that Oswald obtained a job as a photographer
in New Orleans, and now Marina can join him and go to New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Mrs. Paine ever invite you over to the home to meet Marina
Oswald or her husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. No; but she offered to bring Marina to our house. I mean,
she didn't invite me to her own house, but offered to bring Marina to our house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you say to that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. She can bring Marina, but not her husband.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why didn't you want her husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Because he was using again this word, ideinyi. He was in the
third stage of obtaining the Communist membership. Because I am afraid,
and all of us are afraid that they are collecting some information on us and
notifying their own people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By the use of the word "they," who do you mean? Lee Harvey
Oswald, Marina Oswald, or both, or some other person?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Oswald&mdash;the people who are in this particular stage trying to
get promotion. So they would spy on us. I had a fear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you think or did you say anything to Mrs. Paine about whether
Marina Oswald had anything to do with this group that might be trying to spy,
or what have you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. If I said <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. To Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. No; have not said. However, I said to Mrs. Paine to be more
careful.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did Mrs. Paine say to that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. She said, "don't worry." Mrs. Paine is an American woman,
and she is very naive, as all Americans are naive, nice, and very generous.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Are you a citizen, Mrs. Gravitis?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Are you coming here voluntarily to testify before the Warren
Commission, the President's Commission on the Assassination of President
Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Yes; we received a letter from Washington, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. But you are here voluntarily to testify here? You have been
asked to come here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Nobody dragged us here; yes. We certainly volunteered, if
you interpret it that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there any other information you can give about Lee Harvey
Oswald or Marina Oswald that you feel might be helpful in any way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. You mean personal opinion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Mrs. Paine told me that Oswald&mdash;I did not know her last
name, she always called her Marina and Lee&mdash;so Mrs. Paine told me that Lee
wants to send his wife to the Soviet Union. I asked why. She said, "She was
pregnant." And she said, "Lee said that he doesn't have money to pay doctor
bills, but had enough money to send her back to the Soviet Union." I said that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
this isn't true. I was surprised, and I replied that this isn't true, because it is
possible if a person doesn't have money, that medical help would be given for
free here in the States. That is, Mrs. Paine was surprised if this could be true,
that we could get local free help. I suggested to her to contact her personal
physician and he will send Marina somewhere.</p>

<p>She said I will go on my way back from vacation and pick up Marina and
bring her. And then when she got back, she called me again and said she is
very happy for this suggestion, that Marina got free medical help, had another
baby, and even the doctor offered with her dental work, and she said the treatment
was excellent in the hospital. I was very surprised how Mrs. Paine didn't
know, and Oswald being also an American didn't know that local help or local
medical help is available to people who don't have money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Mrs. Paine or Marina Oswald or anyone say anything more
to you about Marina Oswald or Lee Harvey Oswald that you think should be
noted here, that we should discuss?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Maybe, but I don't remember right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else that you care to add?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Mrs. Paine told me that Lee is very bad husband, that he even
hit her, Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did Mrs. Paine tell you this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. When she went to pick up Marina in New Orleans. She said,
"I have to go in person to pick her up because I cannot write her things like
that, that Lee would read her letters and then would reprimand his wife."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did she say whether Marina said that this had been different,
that Lee had always been this way about hitting his wife, or was this something
different that happened when they came to New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Marina did not tell me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I mean Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. I didn't ask and she didn't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there any other information that you can think of that might
be helpful here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Mrs. Paine was at our house the first of April of this year,
1964. I asked if she thought if Marina would know if Lee had intended to
kill somebody, or President. And Mrs. Paine replied that she thought that
Marina did not know. However, she felt that Marina knew that Oswald was
in Mexico, but she didn't tell Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What do you mean she didn't tell Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Excuse me, Marina didn't tell Mrs. Paine. Marina knew
that Oswald was in Mexico, but about his being there, didn't tell Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why do you feel that Mexico was very important?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Because I felt that he was preparing himself for a trip somewhere;
either Cuba or somewhere else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. But this is just a feeling, or did you have any facts upon which
to base it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. No; this is my personal feeling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Any other facts that you know of that might be helpful here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. I would help you more, but I don't have enough acquaintance
here in town that I really feel that I would know more. I know Mrs. Paine
beside her Russian tutoring so well, because Mrs. Paine or her husband left
her. She was separated or still is separated, so Mrs. Paine more or less came
to me an elderly person for advice. Her husband came home after the President
was assassinated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why did he come home, do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. I asked her, but Mrs. Paine said she don't know why. And
she still has domestic problems. I feel that he would like to make it easier
on her after that particular time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you can think of that might be relevant?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, we want to thank you very much for coming down here,
Mrs. Gravitis, and also thank you very much, for your help.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Gravitis</span>. Thank you; Mr. Belin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Your mother-in-law has the opportunity to read the deposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
and sign it or make corrections. Do you want to come down and do that with
her some time, or do you want to waive the signing and let it go directly to
Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. She trusts you without signing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So you waive the signing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Mamantov</span>. Yes.</p>

<h2 id="prg">TESTIMONY OF PAUL RODERICK GREGORY</h2>

<p>The testimony of Paul Roderick Gregory was taken at 4 p.m., on March 31,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I would like to advise you that my name is Wesley J. Liebeler.
I am a member of the legal staff of the President's Commission investigating the

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I want to inquire of you today concerning your knowledge of
Lee Harvey Oswald and Marina Oswald, which we understand you gained as a
result of your association with the Oswalds, basically during 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you state your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Paul Roderick Gregory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are presently a student of the University of Oklahoma;
isn't that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What are you studying at the University of Oklahoma?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Russian language and literature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What year are you in at the University?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. First year graduate student.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You already hold a degree from the University?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I have a bachelor's degree in economics.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are now pursuing a master's or doctor's?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. A master's degree.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In the subject you have just indicated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes; Russian language and literature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are the son, are you not, of Peter Paul Gregory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where does he live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. 3513 Dorothy Lane, Fort Worth, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your father is originally from somewhere in Siberia, is that
not correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And he came to the United States approximately when, do you
know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I would guess about 1920, or '21, or '22. I am not sure of the
exact year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He has engaged in business as a geological consultant, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When is the last time you were home in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I can't tell you the exact date. It must have been February
the 10th, I believe, or February the 9th, because it was right around my birthday,
which is February the 10th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What year were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. 1941.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you had occasion to speak with your father over the
telephone or to exchange letters with him since the time he appeared before
the Commission in Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I spoke with him approximately three times since that, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you discuss with him the testimony that he gave before
the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No. He only said that he mentioned my name. That is the
only thing he said about the testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did there come a time when you met Lee Harvey Oswald
and his wife, Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us when that was and the circumstances of
that event?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I met Lee and Marina Oswald in the summer of 1962. I would
suppose in the middle of June. I met them both at Lee's brother's house in
the western part of Fort Worth. Lee Oswald had become acquainted with my
father a week or two weeks earlier. I think he came to him with the desire
to get some kind of paper showing his ability in the Russian language; I think
he wanted to get a job as interpreter or something; some kind of work which
would have something to do with his ability to use Russian.</p>

<p>I think he came in my father's office twice. I am not sure, because I wasn't
there, and gave him the address of his brother where he was staying at the
time.</p>

<p>And I don't know, he may have said, "Come see us." And my father and I
were both interested in meeting his wife who was Russian, we heard. So, I
believe my father found out their address and we went out for a visit, purely
social visit. That was, as I say, probably in the middle of June, 1962, and that
was the first time I ever met either Lee Oswald or Marina Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know that at some time, in about June of 1962, your
father invited the Oswalds to come to your house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was that before or after the time that you mentioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. That was at the end of the summer. They had actually been
at our house twice. One time about a month before this dinner at our house.
I just drove by with them for a few minutes. That was the first time they had
ever been to our house. And the second time was at this dinner which you
mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When was the dinner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I can't give you the date. It was near the end of the summer,
I imagine, in August, 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So the first time, then, that you met Oswald was at his brother's
place in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who was present at that first meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. His brother's name, I think, was Bob Oswald. Bob Oswald's
wife and their children, I think they had two or three young kids, Lee, and
Marina, and June Lee, their baby, those were the only people there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Plus your father and yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us, to the best of your recollection, what the conversation
was at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I remember they brought out pictures which they had taken in
the Soviet Union and showed us where they had lived in Minsk, and I believe they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
might have had pictures of Leningrad. I am not sure. And then this evening
there was something said about their trip back, how they passed through Poland
and Germany. And then my father wanted to know how, what Marina thought
of Russia, if it had changed after all the years. And that was the general tone
of the conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you remember any details of the conversation about the
Oswalds' life in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. At this time I did not. Later on we had quite a bit of discussion
about it, but not this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you go through the period of time that you knew the
Oswalds, and to the best of your recollection tell us the approximate number
of times that you saw them and the circumstances under which you saw them,
and the dates that you can remember, from the first time you met them at Robert
Oswald's house at Fort Worth, to the last time that you saw them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Okay. We have already gone through the first meeting, and
right after the first meeting I left town for about a month. I visited in San
Francisco. I returned and then we decided it would be a good idea if I would
take Russian lessons from Marina, and it would be quite a big help.</p>

<p>Therefore, the second time I saw them was in June, the middle of June, a
month, and to the 10th of August, let's say, just as a guess, we went over to
their house, my father and I.</p>

<p>We had to go somewhere, and therefore we only stayed for about ten minutes.
And we said, "Paul would like to take Russian lessons from Marina," and she
said, "Fine." And I set up dates to go twice a week, I think Tuesdays and
Thursdays, or Tuesdays and Fridays&mdash;I can't remember the exact dates. Therefore,
I was at their house two times a week from, say, the middle of August
until I went back to school which was in the middle of September.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you also present at the dinner which your father gave
for the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who else was present at that dinner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Myself, my father, the Oswalds, George Bouhe, Anna Meller,
her husband, I can't remember his first name; then Mrs. Clark and Mr. Clark.
I can't give you their first names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You clearly remember that they were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I think they were there. I could be mistaken. There is a possibility
they weren't. I can't remember exactly.</p>

<p>Usually, the reason is, whenever we have the Russians over, they were there.
Now that I think about it, they weren't, because I believe my mother was the
only one that didn't understand, and Mrs. Clark's husband didn't understand
Russian. Therefore, I guess they weren't there. Then my mother was there
and June Lee was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The Oswalds' little girl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes. I believe that was all. And I saw them once more, if you
are interested. That was probably the Friday or Saturday after Thanksgiving
of 1962.</p>

<p>Marina called up. I was home for vacation. And she said that she and Lee
were at Robert Oswald's house for Thanksgiving dinner, or something, and she
wanted me to come over and pick them up and have the visit, and I would take
them down to the bus station, because they rode the bus over from Dallas.</p>

<p>They had since then moved to Dallas. And I went and picked them up and
brought them back to our house and we had sandwiches, and I took them down
to the bus station, and that was the last time I saw them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You just left them off at the bus station and they went and
got on the bus, and as far as you know, went back to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't pay for the bus tickets, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You let them off at the bus station in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You let them&mdash;did you ever give any money to either Lee or
Marina Oswald?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes; I gave Marina a check. As I remember, it was around
$35 or $40, something like that.</p>

<p>This was for the Russian lessons which she did give me. As I remember,
$35, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is that all the money that you gave to either of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And that check was made out to Marina Oswald, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever lend the Oswalds any money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever see anybody else ever give either of the Oswalds
any money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know of anybody else ever giving them any money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I believe Mr. Bouhe gave them money. I know he gave them
gifts, playthings for their daughter, and possibly clothes. I heard he gave them
clothes, but I, myself, did not see this, so that is hearsay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did either of the Oswalds ever spend any money or pay any
bills while in your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes. I often took them&mdash;I believe the second day I would go
over in the week was Friday, and I would usually take them shopping and we
would go down to a Leonard Department Store where you could get groceries
cheaper, and they would buy their groceries at this time. But the only articles
they were purchasing in my presence was food.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any recollection of approximately how much they
spent on food?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. It was very little. I recall I was amazed at how little they
bought, and that Lee would always be very careful with the meat. He would
be sure to get the cheapest possible cut he could get, and he would haggle and
make sure they gave him the best. I mean, that he would get the better cuts
and things like that. I remember they bought very little though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Other than the groceries, you never saw them spend any money
or pay any bills; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You did not see them? I suppose the answer should be, "Yes;
I did not see them"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes; I did not see them paying any bills.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did the Oswalds ever discuss their finances with you, or discuss
their finances between themselves that you ever heard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Not that I can remember. There is something faintly about
them saying, "Well, if we had this money, we would buy something for June
Lee," but I can't think of any specific instance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, taking all of your experiences with the Oswalds together
and all of the conversations that you had with them, would you relate to us
what they told you, and differentiate between Lee or Marina, as best you can,
about the whole Russian episode, why Oswald went to Russia; what he did
when he was there; how he met Marina; why he decided to come back; and
how he came back, and so on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. On one of the questions I can't answer very well because I
never discussed with him why he went. I personally never asked him.</p>

<p>At this dinner, I am sure you have already heard an account of it, he explained
that he went because he was disgusted with the American system or the capitalist
system where everything is run by money and the desire to get money.
That seemed to be his only objection, that I ever heard, and his only reason
as to why he left.</p>

<p>Let's see, what was the other. Oh, according to Lee, then also he was very
disgusted with the Marines, how the Marines had treated him. I don't know
if you could classify that as a reason for him leaving and going to the Soviet
Union. Maybe it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did he tell you about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Oh, I just asked him&mdash;I knew he had been in the Marines&mdash;what
he thought of it. He would never speak of it. He was sort of&mdash;look disgusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
and say, "I don't want to talk about it," or something like that. Those
are the only two reasons which I heard, and the second one would be one which
I am not sure of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He never discussed with you beyond the extent you have indicated,
his experience in the Marine Corps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; he was disgusted with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever indicate anything about his discharge from the
Marines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; he never did. I think a lot of things which he told me were
like the way he talked, that he graduated from high school, from the same
high school that I had gone to, and I read in the papers that he was only there
a month or so. So, possibly a lot of information which he had given me would
not be right, but he never did speak of a discharge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Whether it would be right or not, it is important that you tell
us what he told you. You indicate now that he did tell you that he graduated
from Arlington Heights High School, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you believed that until after the assassination and you
read in the newspaper that he had not, in fact, graduated from Arlington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you what kind of job he had in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. He was in some kind of factory. Evidently, according to him,
it had something to do with radio equipment, because I remember asking him
once about thievery in the Soviet Union, because I always read or had thought
that factory workers take what they need and barter because they don't get
enough or are not able to make enough money to buy all they need. And he
said that he himself had stolen a radio and phonograph. From that I know it
was some kind of a shop and he ran some kind of a machine. Because he told
me of some incident when he had to&mdash;the shop had to be changed, or they moved
the equipment into another building, and the first thing they moved was the
picture of Lenin and later they moved the equipment. It was heavy equipment,
and they set the machines so that the men could work facing Lenin. And then
they decided Lenin had to be hung in the most favorable place in the shop, and
the Commissar came in and inspected the next setup and decided Lenin wasn't
in the right place, and, therefore, they had to come back in and completely
remount all the machinery and turn it around to face Lenin's new position.</p>

<p>He brought that up as a&mdash;I would ask him about what the people in the Soviet
Union think of a person who is a member of the Communist Party. And he
seemed to classify all members of the Communist Party as opportunists who
were in it just to get something for themselves out of it, and he brought up
this incident here because it was a Communist Party man who came in and said
you have to put Lenin back there, and therefore you have to completely re-do
all the machinery. He thought it was stupid. And he said all the members
of the Communist Party were always the ones that shouted the loudest and
made the most noise and pretended to be the most patriotic, but he seemed
to have quite a disgust for the members of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He indicated quite a disgust for them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes; he thought they were opportunists and it was my impression
that he thought they were ruining the principles which the country
should be based on. In other words, they were not true Communists. They
were ruining the heaven on earth which it should be, in his opinion. That
might have been a personal interpretation on my part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you anything more than the kind of place that
he worked and what he did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Just that he worked in a shop that I mentioned. I remember
his main complaint about his life there was that he didn't get enough to eat,
that he had to go, either he or Marina, would have to go stand in line in order
to get anything, and he seemed to have only potatoes and cabbage while he
was there. And he would always speak about how poorly he ate. That seemed
to be his great objection to the Soviet Union, that he didn't eat very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate that the same was true of other Soviet citizens,
<span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. They all had the same trouble?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate in any way that he might have received more
favorable treatment as compared to other Soviet citizens who held similar jobs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No. I think he was under the opinion that he possibly received
worse than just average treatment, because I think in the Soviet Union, as I
understand it, the methods of the bestowing of favors is to give somebody a good
apartment, because of the housing shortage. And he complained that he did not
get good housing. He lived in a poor apartment, and that he was unable to
change his job or leave, because he had no place to go.</p>

<p>If he would leave or go to another factory, he would not be able to get a new
apartment. And I think I asked him a question about are people in the Soviet
Union free to change jobs and travel from place to place, and he said maybe
technically but they can't because it depends on the apartment.</p>

<p>Then, as to whether he got special treatment, I asked Marina. I said, "Was
he the center of attention in Russia," and she said he was quite a, I wouldn't
say freak or oddity, but something quite unusual, and I am sure he enjoyed
this fact that he was the center of attention. She said she met him at a dance,
I guess in Minsk, and she didn't know who he was, and she danced with him or
something, and thought he was, because of his accent, thought he was from
the Baltic States, and later somebody called her aside and said, "I guess you
don't know who he is," and so forth, and I guess they more or less left him alone.</p>

<p>I know he mentioned having several friends in the Soviet Union. One was
some young fellow, I think his name was Pavel, and possibly another fellow, and
I know after he was in the United States he continued to correspond with these
people over there.</p>

<p>He showed me letters which he had written to them or which he was getting
ready to send, and letters which he had received. I believe one was the son of a
highly fairly influential person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would that have been Pavel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I think. I just remember something about him, about him
being a general's son or a colonel's son.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember his last name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you think you would remember it if I mention it to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. There is a possibility. I believe they let me read one letter
which was harmless. There was no&mdash;I mean it was a personal letter. Maybe
I would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. G-o-l-a-c-h-e-v [spelling], would that be the name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. It might be. To tell you the truth, the first name Pavel, I am
fairly sure of the Pavel part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; I think that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. That is the only name I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't remember the name of this other fellow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald let you read any letters other than the one you
just mentioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No. It may have just arrived or he was explaining something
about how you address a letter differently. How you put where it is going at
the top, and the return at the bottom. He was showing me something, and
as I recall, I read the letter, but it was just personal matters. I can't even
remember the contents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have no recollection of the contents of the letter at this
point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there anything in it, as far as you can remember, that
would indicate that it was secretive or anything of that sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. On this question of whether Oswald thought that possibly he
was treated less favorably than other Soviet citizens, there has been some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
testimony that he perhaps felt disenchanted with the Soviet Union because he
was not given the kind of job that he expected to be given when he got there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes; I remember something now. He expected&mdash;I think he and
I got along well because he considered me fairly smart because I was interested
in the Soviet matters, and therefore our discussions were quite a bit about
academic matters, and he pretended, or possibly was, fairly well educated. He
seemed to read quite a bit. But he expected to go over there and get into a
Russian university. He made an application for the Peace University or one
of these universities for the foreign students, I think, and he was quite disenchanted
when he was not accepted into this. That was his first idea, I believe, to
go over there and go to school. Then after he was not accepted, they sent him
somewhere to work in a little factory, and I guess he didn't quite like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you that one of the reasons he had gone to Russia
was to enter college or university there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I don't know as that was one of his reasons for going, but that
seemed to me, according to him, the first thing he did was make this application.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever mention to you anything about an application to the
Albert Schweitzer College in Switzerland? Did he indicate to you in any other
way that he was dissatisfied with the treatment he had received by Russian
authorities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Well, there was. He said when he wanted to return, it was
touch and go whether Marina would get to come back with him, and he felt that
she had been discriminated against, because he told about meetings which they
had held in the factory or place where Marina worked denouncing her as a
traitor, et cetera, because she wanted to leave the country. And I think this
went on for weeks and weeks where they put pressure on her not to go with
him, and he expressed amazement for the fact that they did allow her to return
with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember any more of the details about what he said
about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. About these meetings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. About the meetings and his expression of amazement as to why
they did let Marina come back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I think he said something about it was just an accident where
maybe 1 out of 10 just happens to get through where they allow it. He seemed
to think there was no special reason that they let her go. It was more or less
an accident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he say that to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Or an exception, yes, as I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So that he indicated to you his surprise that Marina had been
permitted to leave the Soviet Union with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He explained it basically in terms of an accident or something
that he couldn't readily explain?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he offer as a suggestion as to why they had permitted
Marina to come back anything to the effect that it was a time of reduced tension
between the Soviet Union and the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Not that I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you remember anything else that he said about the subject
of Marina being able to come back with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No. Marina spoke of it as being a very horrible time with all
her friends putting pressure on her, and it was very unpleasant for her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she indicate that she had had any nervous difficulties as
a result of this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you learn at any time from either of the Oswalds that
Marina had gone to the hospital as the result of the pressure that was put
upon her by her friends?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she mention to you, or either of them mention to you, that
Marina went to Kharkov on a vacation at one time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; I asked them about travel that each of them had done in
the Soviet Union, and the only other place that they mentioned as having been,
or one of them as having been, was Leningrad, which was the city where Marina
received her training as a pharmacist. And I don't know if Lee had gone to
Leningrad or not. Of course, Lee would always tell me about his trips to Moscow
and his trips to the mausoleum, and going to all the museums and factories.
He seemed to speak as if he were a regular tourist then, because they assigned
him an interpreter, and evidently he paid the regular tourist fee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you when this was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; he may have told me. I am sure it was in winter, because
he said&mdash;no, I am not sure. Put this down as something I don't remember well,
but I think that he said that it was cold and that the Russians let him get up
to the first line because he was an American. It could have been someone else,
because I have had several friends that&mdash;I can't remember if that was Lee or
not.</p>

<p>When he did speak of, I believe when we were having our conversations was
after&mdash;I can't remember when the de-Stalinization was, when they took Stalin
out of the mausoleum, but it happened before Lee came back, and I asked him
about that. That was another thing he seemed to get quite a laugh out of. He
looked at it very skeptically and thought the Russians should be laughed at for
doing things like this, where the street signs would change overnight and no
one would mention Stalin's name any more, and he thought it was highly
comical. I am saying this to show that, in my opinion, he wasn't&mdash;never mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. No; I would like to hear your remarks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Well, I don't know how to put it. In other words, he looked
at things critically over there.</p>

<p>He was not one who would say Khrushchev said this, therefore it is right.
He always was more or less critically observant of everything he saw over
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you say critically, you mean, as I understand now your
use of the word, he attempted to observe things objectively and perceptively?
He just didn't follow things because somebody handed it out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't mean to use the words in the sense that he was
just complaining about things, do you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I could say you can use it in both senses. My main point was
that if Khrushchev says this, well, any good party man or anyone who would be
a conformist, if Khrushchev says that is fine, he was not that type. He always
expressed a great admiration for Khrushchev. He seemed to think he was quite
a brilliant man. And he said you cannot read a speech of Khrushchev's without
liking the man. He said he was a very rough man, a very crude man, but he
thought of him as a very brilliant man and very able leader.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you remember anything else that he might have said about
him, Mr. Khrushchev?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Well, he might have spoken of him several times, but that was
the general idea. And while we were on Khrushchev, whenever he would
speak about Khrushchev, Kennedy would naturally come into mind, and he
expressed admiration of Kennedy.</p>

<p>Both he and Marina would say, "Nice young man." I never heard him say
anything derogatory about Kennedy. He seemed to admire the man, because
I remember they had a copy of Life magazine which was always in their
living room, and it had Kennedy's picture on it, or I believe Kennedy or someone
else, and he always expressed what I would interpret as admiration for Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you recall any specific details concerning his remarks about
Kennedy or the conversation that you had with him concerning Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; just that one time, as I can remember in their apartment
that we did look at this picture of Kennedy, and Marina said, "He looks like a
nice young man." And Lee said something, yes, he is a good leader, or something,
as I remember, was a positive remark about Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He never expressed any adverse feelings or made any adverse
remarks about President Kennedy in your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever hear of him making any such remarks in the
presence of anyone else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever mention Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever hear through any other source that he made any
remarks about Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As far as Marina was concerned, you indicated that she too
expressed a kindly feeling or a good feeling toward President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would that indicate to you that Oswald had probably indicated
such feelings to her, since she was not able to read English or understand
English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Or didn't you think about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I didn't think about it, and would not think that would be
true. I couldn't answer the question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you form any opinion of Marina's ability to speak English
during the time you knew her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Very poor. She knew two or three words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was that true throughout the entire time you knew her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes; the very last time I ever saw her was at Robert Oswald's
house and all she could say was "excuse me," because she would go sit in the
corner while everyone else ate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. While everybody else what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Ate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. She didn't eat with you when she was sitting in the corner
and all the other relatives were sitting around the dinner table?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes; evidently she had eaten before I got there, just in time
to take them by, but every time I would go over I would ask, "What have you
learned in English," and she would always say, "I haven't learned a thing."
I personally gave her some vocabulary which I had used to study Russian,
which she could use in the reverse manner to study English words and I assumed
that would help her. I don't know if she used them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever think that Marina was deceptive as to the extent
to which she could understand English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; I don't believe so. Well, she never spoke English with
me, or never attempted to speak English. She would say, "How do you do,"
something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What about Oswald's proficiency in Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. He spoke a very ungrammatical Russian with a very strong
accent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What kind of accent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Well, I can't tell you, because I am not that much of a judge.
You would have to ask an expert about that. It was this poorly spoken Russian,
but he was completely fluent. He understood more than I did and he could
express any idea, I believe, that he wanted to in Russian. But it was heavily
pronounced and he made all kinds of grammatical errors, and Marina would
correct him, and he would get peeved at her for doing this. She would say you
are supposed to say like this, and he would wave his hand and say, "Don't bother
me."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He indicated that he didn't care to have Marina correct him
as far as his use of the Russian language was concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever have any discussion with them as to why Marina
did not learn English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I said I thought it was kind of strange that she was not picking
up anything, but her expression was that she had to stay home and she
had no opportunity to speak. I did not observe any obvious attempts on Lee's
part to hold back her English, but I guess there was an attempt since he would
not help her himself. Evidently he didn't help her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
I knew that later on George Bouhe tried to teach her English. He would
send her lessons and she would send them back and he would correct them.
I don't know to what extent these lessons went on, but these lessons started
after I had gone away to school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever have any opportunity to judge Oswald's ability
to write the Russian language? You mentioned that you had seen this one
letter. Did you notice any misspelled words in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; I did not see any letter that he had written.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This was a letter that he had received?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I couldn't say at all. I imagine he would have quite a bit
of difficulty, because I don't think he had any understanding of the grammar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you think that his proficiency in Russian was particularly
good, or about average for the length of time he had been in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I couldn't judge. All I think is, he was fluent and he could
read well in Russian. Probably he did have a better grammatical knowledge
than I thought, because of all of the reading which I saw him do, excepting for
a few books, was in Russian.</p>

<p>I mean, if he would sit down to read a book, he would be reading in Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How much did he read?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I couldn't say. He was always going down to the library and
coming back with all kinds of books. Usually he would not read in my presence,
because we would all sit around and talk. Toward the end, I was writing a
paper and I needed Marina's help to correct the grammar, and we would go over
to one side and work on that, and he would sit and read. He read Lenin.
I can't remember which book it was, but that is the only thing I have really
seen him read. And then he always spoke about his, he said, this great love
of history.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever see him read any books other than this book
about Lenin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; it was not about, it was Lenin writings, and Lenin was all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember the name of any books that Oswald brought
home from the library that you saw in his apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I can't remember. It would have been nothing extremely interesting.
I can't give any titles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever discuss with him the nature of his love of the
study of history?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; I always&mdash;my opinion of him was that he was not very
smart. I thought maybe he would read a lot, but not absorb it. That was my
opinion of him.</p>

<p>He just said he always had this love of history, and he several times&mdash;one
evening he went out to TCU and another time he went out to get the catalog
for Arlington State to try to get some night school or something, and this
evidently was a pure dream on his part, seeing he did not have the high school
degree. And he always spoke that he wanted to go back to school and get a
degree and study economics and history and philosophy and things like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He went out to TCU? Did he tell you that he went out to
TCU?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. For what purpose, did he tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. To look for night school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember approximately when that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. It was the first time I ever went over there to have a lesson, he
was gone. And he returned after, say, 15 minutes. He said he was at TCU, and
he had a schedule of their classes. And another time I took and I would take
them out to look at the town. One night we went to TCU, and he asked me, do
you think the director of the evening classes or some official, if they would be in
at this hour, because he wanted to go see, and I said, "No; I am sure no one will
be there."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever tell you that he talked to any of the officials at
TCU concerning the night school program?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; he evidently must have talked to someone if he came back
with a schedule, because I remember looking at the schedule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he come back with the schedule before or after the occasion
on which you were driving in your car to TCU?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; it seems the first evening I went over there he referred to
the schedule.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So, it was after that that he asked you during your drive
whether you thought anybody would be present at TCU?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your first Russian lesson was approximately when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I would say August 10. I would hit it within a week either way.
All this time I thought he had his high school degree and I was encouraging him
to go back. I said, "Why don't you?" And he used as an excuse that he had to
work. And he never did tell me that he did not finish high school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Going back to the statements that he may have made about his
activities in Russia, did he ever indicate to you in any way that he had a source
of income in the Soviet Union other than the income he received from his job
at the factory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; he never did. He always spoke as if he didn't have enough
money over there but he never indicated another source of income.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you how much he was paid for his work at the
factory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. He told, but I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you remember any discussions about his source of income
and what he did with it? I know you cannot specifically remember the amount
that he was paid.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; the only discussion as to how he spent his money was the
tremendous difficulty he had buying food and buying enough food. It seems to
me as if the way he spoke, he spent all the money on food and he had several
articles of clothing which he brought back with him, of which he seemed to be
very proud.</p>

<p>I think he had a pair of boots or something like that, and he had a closet full
of junk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever show you his boots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember anything about them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I am not positive about the boots. I remember he had one article
of clothing which he showed me; said it was made in the Soviet Union, and he
seemed to be proud of it. As I remember, it was boots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have no other recollection about it than what you have
just expressed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; I think a lot of his clothes were from the Soviet Union, but
I can't identify the articles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever mention anything about assistance he might have
received from the Red Cross while he was in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; the only financial spot which he mentioned to me was the
money he got through the U.S. Ambassador to Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did he tell you about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. He just said he went in and told them he wanted to return, and
the fellow gave him something like $300. And then after that, he spoke of his
trip back. He went through Poland and East Germany.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you that he had stayed for a time in Moscow before
leaving the Soviet Union to return?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. The only time I know of his being in Moscow was when he was
there at the very first as a tourist, and that is the only time I heard him mention
being in Moscow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you anything about any difficulties that he encountered
in obtaining the necessary papers for him and Marina to return to the
United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. The only difficulties which I have heard are the difficulties I
have already brought up about the pressure put on Marina. But as far as
paperwork, I can't bring anything out specifically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He never mentioned any difficulty that he encountered with
the U.S. authorities in that regard?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you form an impression as to the feeling he had about
the U.S. officials concerning his return?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. He mentioned that they had given this money to return.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I thought you mentioned that he told you they had loaned him
money to return?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes; I am saying he never expressed an opinion one way or
the other. It seems to me that normally a person in that situation would say
he was very glad they gave him the money. He seemed to expect this money
as if it was something that was due him, and he never expressed any gratitude
toward the Ambassador or whoever it was that gave him the money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he express any resentment toward any of the Government
officials concerning his return?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Completely neutral.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you whether or not he returned the money to the
State Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; he never told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you form any opinion either from your discussions with
Oswald as to whether or not Oswald was well liked in the Soviet Union, and
accepted by the people in the community in which he lived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. As I said before, it seems to me as he was treated as an outsider,
and the only two people I ever heard him speak of were the two I mentioned
besides Marina. Evidently Marina was a special case, that she did
pay attention to him.</p>

<p>He evidently must have been fairly militant over there, or fairly, could I say
not friendly, because he told me of one instance where the fellows at the factory
were studying night course in English or something, and they came to him
and wanted him to help them, and he helped them once or twice, but then he
came to the conclusion they were lazy and he threw them out and told them
he didn't want to help them any more. Evidently, he wasn't too friendly over
there, so I doubt if he had too many acquaintances.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is that all he told you about the incident when the fellow
factory workers were trying to learn English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes; and I think one fellow, Pavel, he came to Lee to help him
with his English and he said this fellow was a good student, and he evidently
gave him quite a bit of help.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Lee gave quite a bit of help to Pavel and Pavel was trying to
learn English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes; but the other fellows he thought were lazy and refused
to pay attention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate whether Pavel gave him any assistance in
learning Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Or whether he received any other training in the Russian language
while he was in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. The only thing he said he learned in the factory when he went
over there, he said he didn't know anything, and when they just stuck him in a
factory, he said he picked it up there, and Marina helped him quite a bit.</p>

<p>Marina told me that Lee's Russian when I was with him was bad compared
to the Russian Lee spoke while he was in the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>In fact, I have Lee's dictionary which he gave me. He gave me his Russian
dictionary and he told me, "I don't need it any more," and therefore he gave me
the dictionary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have that at the present time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where is that, in Norman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. In Norman; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I wonder if you would make that available to us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes; I looked through it to see if there is any writing and
there is no writing. There is something, he wrote a name up there or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. If you would make it available to us, we would appreciate it.
We will have somebody from the Secret Service or FBI contact you in Norman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
and obtain it, or if you want to mail it to us at the Commission. How do you
want to handle it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Either way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. We will have somebody from the Secret Service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I don't know of any writing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. We will make arrangements for someone to pick it up and we
will eventually return it to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes; okay. I have a card also which he sent me, if you are
interested, which was written to inform me a change of address to Dallas,
which was dated on November 1, approximately, 1962. Those are the only two
things I have that belonged to him or were from him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. We would like the card too, if you would make that available.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald mention anything to you about hunting trips that
he went on while he was in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he mention any access that he might have had to firearms?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you form any opinion, or did Marina tell you anything
that would indicate the reason why Marina seemed to take a special interest
in Oswald, or seemed to be a special case, I think you used that terminology?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes. I could tell you&mdash;this is a personal opinion&mdash;but evidently
she was kind of a rebel or nonconformist herself, and she met quite
a bit of opposition because she did see Lee. And I am not sure, but I believe
her family gave her quite a bit of trouble about that, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you remember any specific situation that she may have
said about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. All I know is that when she returned&mdash;she said she had written
her relatives&mdash;she had an uncle and aunt and sister, and they refused to
answer, and she never received an answer from them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, did you infer from that that they gave her difficulty in
connection with her marriage to Lee Oswald, or that they disapproved her decision
to come to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I assume it was both. It is an assumption on my part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Marina never indicated specifically any difficulty that she had
with her relatives?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you form any opinion, or did Marina ever indicate to you
that possibly she married Oswald to get out of the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you never formed that opinion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I never formed that opinion. She seemed quite interested and
quite enthusiastic about a new life in America, and she seemed to me that she
wanted to take part in it, but she got over here and it was, she was just in one
room and never got out, and she always kept saying, "When I learn English,
it will be different."</p>

<p>She always expressed a desire to learn English, and, "Do you think I will
ever be able to learn it?" And I said, "Yes." And she seemed quite enthusiastic
about America.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you think it was strange that she seemed interested to
learn English but apparently made no attempt to learn it? Did you discuss
that with her at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes; I would always ask her, "What have you learned," and
she would say "Nothing." And I said, "Well&mdash;" we really never went into it
completely why she hadn't. I just assumed that either she didn't want to or
else she really didn't have the opportunity to get out, or I can't answer
specifically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. She never indicated a desire to you that you should help her
learn English in connection with her attempt to teach you Russian or to improve
your Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever discuss with Oswald the reason, or with Marina,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
for that matter, the reason why Oswald decided to leave the Soviet Union and
return to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Well, let's see, I have brought up why he was dissatisfied.
Well, of course, he didn't get enough food. That seemed to be one of his major
things.</p>

<p>And evidently he lived fairly poorly over there. Then I am sure he went
over there thinking this would be the heaven on earth, the workers' paradise,
and he quickly found out that wasn't so. This might be a personal judgment
on my part, but I think he felt that they are making a mess of things over there.
Maybe he did believe in communistic principles which I don't believe he understood
if he believed in them. But he felt that the present administration
like the party boys and the people in power were just making a mess of things,
that they didn't know what they were doing. He felt like, he said they were
opportunistic. No; he never came out and said, "I left because so-and-so and
so-and-so."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever indicate a desire to have his children raised in
the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I can't remember if he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You told us a moment ago that Oswald at one point told you
how he had left the Soviet Union and gone through Poland and East Germany.
I would like you to tell us everything you can remember about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I really can't remember anything specifically. I just asked
him how he came out, and he said he was on the train, and something or other
happened in Poland, I didn't quite understand it, where there was some incident
in Poland where they bought something, or some person sold them something
black market and&mdash;I can't remember it, but they never gave me a travellogue
of their trip out of the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you that he eventually went to some point in
Holland and boarded a ship and came back to New York?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. He did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any recollection about that other than what I
have just stated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you how he got from his landing point in the
United States to Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you where he landed in the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know that now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever indicate any dissatisfaction with the conditions
here in the United States other than the ones that you previously indicated
that he expressed? That is, that everyone seemed to be concerned about making
money? Did he ever indicate that he thought particular institutions ought
to be changed in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; his only objection that he ever voiced to me was about
the money everyone was out for themselves, and evidently he never had much
money, and I guess he felt persecuted on account of this. I remember one
evening I gave him a tour of the town, and I took them to, you know, drove
by all the big mansions. I figured they would be interested in seeing that, and
it seems like there if he would really have any strong feelings, they would have
come out then.</p>

<p>He said something about how horrible it is that here people are living in these
big mansions, and I think just before that we had seen a bad part of town
where the colored people lived, but he made no comment there. I think he
just said, "Well, I never want to be rich like that."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He indicated no particular animosity toward people of wealth
and position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Going back to his experience in the Soviet Union, did he ever
tell you that he had ever been in the hospital there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you any of the details about his marriage to Marina,
as to any difficulties they experienced in getting permission to become married,
or anything of that nature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; I don't think so. As I remember, it happened quite fast.
I believe they were married 2 or 3 weeks after they met.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you think of anything else that he ever told you about
his experiences in the Soviet Union that we haven't already covered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Not at the moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald ever discuss any subject concerning Russian military
movements or the presence of troops, concentration of equipment, aircraft
and that sort of thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Never mentioned it at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You told us before that you held a bachelor degree from
Oklahoma University and that you majored in economics?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever discuss economics with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I never discussed it with him because I don't think he knew
anything about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did the subject ever come up between you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. He would always say that is my great love, history and
economics.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did he say about it? I am interested in this, because
I gained the impression from others that he didn't know very much about it.
In my opinion you probably do know more about it than most of the men that
I talked to, so I would like to have you tell us as much as you can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. He never said anything, and that is the reason I got the impression
he didn't know anything about it, because if he knew, he would want
to talk about it. I never approached the subject because he seemed to not
want to get into it. I thought from an interview with him, when they were
having all this on TV, that they asked him a question, something about comparative
economics, and he gave some kind of stupid answer and more or less
confirmed my opinion that he didn't know too much about it. But we never
did have a specific discussion about economics.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever discuss with Oswald any contacts between him
and agents of the Soviet Government in connection with any attempt on their
part to recruit him as an intelligence agent or as open activity of the Soviet
Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever discuss it with anybody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did it ever occur to you that Oswald might be an agent of
the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; I was always fairly positive that he wasn't, because I
figured that if the Soviets wanted to get someone, they could get someone a
lot more reliable. They would have a lot more sense than to get him, because
I think he was, personally had a bad temper, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What makes you say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Well, he would always, he never really didn't get mad, but he
would&mdash;I never did figure out if he and Marina were arguing or just talking,
but he would always shout, and I remember one evening that we went out, were
going to the grocery store, and Marina had June in her arms and she stepped
over and fell off the porch, and boy he got mad. You know, the baby fell on
the ground. He really got mad. And that was the only time I ever saw him
real mad. I guess maybe he had reason to be mad, because Marina had dropped
the child.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she fall out of her arms?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. They both fell. She hurt her back. I thought she had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did he do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. He went over and picked up the baby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Then what did he say?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. He got real mad, and then they ran in and they had the medical
book written in Russian about baby care, and they went through it and I think
the baby had a cut on its head, and Marina had a cut on her knee or something,
and everything quieted down and we went out again, but it was a real hot
moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Other than the fact that you noted, is there any other reason
why you said you thought he had a bad temper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I heard afterward, after the last time I saw him, I heard reports
about him beating her, from the Dallas acquaintances.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never saw any evidence of that yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No. One time I went over and she had a black eye. At this
time I had no suspicion, that&mdash;but possibly I never asked her where did you get
the black eye.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you never had any reason to think <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That he had been mistreating her, based on your own experience?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Later when I heard about this in Dallas, well I thought maybe
it could have happened back there then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are there any other reasons on which you base your opinion
that he had a bad temper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No, just personal judgment. He seemed to be a small person
that is always ready to flare up. We always had very good relations. We were
very friendly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Other than the fact that you think he had a bad temper, is there
any other reason why you think the Soviets would not recruit him as an agent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. As I say again, I don't think he was very smart.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are there any other reasons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No. Then, of course, his animosity which he expressed toward
the Soviet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Towards the members of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes. He didn't quite enjoy life over there, and it just didn't
enter my mind that he could have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did it ever enter your mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It is only after the assassination that you considered this
question; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Even then I never considered it seriously.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But my question is: When did you consider it at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Only after, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes. I think this might be important. More or less his philosophy,
which I think came out, is that at the time I was interested in going
and studying in the Soviet Union in our exchange program. We have an exchange
where our University sends over students and they send over to ours,
and I was interested in seeing how it was, how life would be, see if it would
be too hard, and he says, he told me, "Just go over there. Don't get on a waiting
list. You will never get there."</p>

<p>He said, "If you want to do something, go ahead and do it. You will get
involved in red tape." And I think that was possibly the way he thought about
everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever form an impression of Oswald, based on your
association with him, form an opinion prior to the time of the assassination
that he was mentally unstable, too, in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You did not? He did not appear to be that to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Let's say, I wouldn't classify him as&mdash;evidently he was, but at
the time I didn't think he was. I just thought he was, as I say, fairly hot
tempered and not extremely brilliant.</p>

<p>But I never did think of him as mentally deranged. Maybe I saw him mixed
up. He must have been mixed up to do what he did, as far as the assassination,
but just going over to the Soviet <span class="locked">Union&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you consider this question prior to the assassination? The
question is, tell us in your own words what opinion you formed of Oswald and
what you thought about him at the time you knew him in 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I never minded him. I always enjoyed being with him. I
enjoyed Marina more than Lee. She was a very pleasant person, very pleasant
to be with, interesting. I can't say that I disliked Lee. He had bad qualities,
but I mean, when we were together, I think he more or less put on his best
front, because I think he considered me someone he could talk to. Because I
think he considered other people beneath him, and he thought that everyone was
judging him.</p>

<p>I think he felt that his brother&mdash;this is a personal opinion&mdash;that they were
sort of taking him in out of the goodness of their hearts.</p>

<p>And I never expressed any judgment on it or even asked him or faced the
matter as to why he had done what he did. Therefore, our relations were always
good. But still I classified him as hot tempered, not very smart, and slightly
mixed up. And I am sure about a good many other examples, but I am not a
psychiatrist or psychologist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you are saying not very smart, are you talking about
what your impression of what his intelligence or what his level of education?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I am thinking of academic sense, inability to grasp things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Basically a function of his IQ rather than his formal education?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you ever interested in his formal education, or make
any inquiries on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes; I was interested in it as to whether he finished high school,
and that he had expressed to me desire to go on in higher education.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. We have already covered that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever indicate to you, or did you ever form the opinion,
that he was capable of violent acts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; I didn't think he was. I would say maybe I could only
picture him getting into a fight or something. Judging from the type of person
he was, if someone would insult him, I think he would get into a fight, but
as far as the major violent act, I couldn't picture him doing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you consider that question prior to the time of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It just never occurred to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No. Just an automatic judgment like I make, a general judgment
about all people, I figured he was the type person, if you go downtown
with him and someone would say, would insult him, he would probably get into
a fight or something like that. That is just my general judgment of him. He
never did in my presence, or nothing ever happened. It is just a general
judgment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The kind of judgment you would make about many people,
is it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There never was anything peculiar about Oswald that caused
you to form a peculiar judgment about him or think he was peculiar in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But he was the kind that easily flared up, although he never
did it in your presence, he was the type that would, and you did think that about
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes. But as far as any violence, I couldn't picture him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald ever indicate to you that the world situation was
not due to the people in the world, but was caused by the leaders in the various
countries?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I think so. Once or twice he made that exact statement, and
I can't remember if it was Marina or Lee. That is the exact words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was that translated into any animosity against the leaders
of the two countries, either Khrushchev or Kennedy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I could not say. I would not think so, because of what I have
already said about the fact that Lee had expressed admiration of Khrushchev
and had expressed that positive feeling toward Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now that I have called to your attention and you recall that
either Lee or Marina did make a remark about the world troubles being caused
by the leaders and not the people, does that cause you to reflect on your prior
testimony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; I don't think so. There was no animosity in the statement.
It was more or <span class="locked">less&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Philosophical opposition&mdash;no personal animosity expressed at
all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; no such animosity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know of any connection between Lee Oswald and Jack
Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any knowledge of Oswald's drinking habits, as far
as alcoholic beverages are concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. He never drank in my presence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether or not Oswald was interested in any
other women during the time that you knew him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever hear that he was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever express an interest in guns to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever observe any firearms in his presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Or in his possession?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Or discuss the subject of firearms?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. During these lessons that you received from Marina in the
Russian language, was Oswald usually present or usually absent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Usually present. In fact, he was always there. The first time
I was ever over was the time that he was away somewhere, and he came back,
say, 10 minutes after the lesson started.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That was the time he had been to TCU?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever hear of any attempt on Oswald's part to commit
suicide?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The same question as to Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know James Martin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never met James Martin at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you meet him in Oklahoma?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; I never met him in Oklahoma.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know anyone by the name of James Martin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. The only persons I ever met in Lee's presence are his brother,
and Thanksgiving when I went to pick him up there was another half brother
and his wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The name was Pic, was it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes. I learned that after the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After the assassination did you learn that there was a man
by the name of James Martin who became Marina's business manager?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I believe I read the name in the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you never met him either in Fort Worth or Norman or
any other place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Never heard of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Just never met him&mdash;any individual, who appeared to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
Marina's business agent, whether or not his name was James Martin or anything
else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any conversation with Lee or Marina about
Marguerite Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No. He never mentioned the fact that he even had a mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever observe Lee Oswald driving an automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No. I asked him if he could drive. He said, "Yes." But if
we ever went anywhere, I drove.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember anything more about that? Was that just
a simple statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I just simply said, "Do you know how to drive?" And he
said, "Yes."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you ask him that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I don't remember whether we were going out to some grocery
store or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you never saw him drive a car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No. He would walk great distances without thinking about it.
I mean, what is in our estimation a great distance. And then he rode the bus
quite a bit. But I never saw him drive a car or heard of him driving a car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you surprised when you learned that Oswald had been
arrested in connection with the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Very.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us something about your state of mind at that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Well, my first impression was, I saw him on television when
they first brought him in, and they didn't mention his name. And later they
said the first suspect being brought in is Lee Oswald. I felt sure he had not
done it. I felt that they probably brought him in because of his record in the
Soviet Union and thought maybe he would be a likely person, but I did not think
he had done it.</p>

<p>The only time I decided he may have done it was when the Secret Service talked
to me and said the evidence <span class="locked">looked&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Talked to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes; it was on a Saturday after the assassination, and said
it looked like he was the one. And my&mdash;I more or less reoriented my thinking
that he was the one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who from the Secret Service talked to you; do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I can't remember. Real nice fellow. Oklahoma City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mr. Nielsen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I think that was it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he outline the evidence to you relating to Oswald's alleged
guilt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; he just said something that, I think something came over
the radio that the chief of police said he was the one, and then he made a
phone call and he said it looked like he was the one, or something like that.
Something that he identified the gun or, I can't remember the exact words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember any organizations of which Lee Oswald was
a member during the time you knew him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever hear of any organizations to which he belonged?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know of the names of any people with whom he
associated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; besides his brother and myself. That is it. Oh, then the
Dallas Russians who I have mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know a gentleman by the name of Gary Taylor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know George De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I think I heard my father mention the name De Mohrenschildt.
I think he is from Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you do not know him personally, however?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I have no further questions. If there is anything that you
would like to add to the record, we would like to have you do it.</p>

<p>If there is anything you think I should have asked you about that I haven't,
I would like to have you mention it and we will put it on the record now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; I think you have covered it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In that case, we will terminate the deposition. I want to thank
you very much, Mr. Gregory, for driving all the way from Norman to Dallas
to give us your testimony. The Commission appreciates it very much.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="mhl">TESTIMONY OF MRS. HELEN LESLIE</h2>

<p>The testimony of Mrs. Helen Leslie was taken at 3:20 p.m., on April 1, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Albert E. Jenner, Jr., assistant counsel of the
President's Commission. Robert T. Davis, assistant attorney general of Texas,
was present.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is Mrs. Helen Leslie of 4209 Hanover Street, Fort Worth,
Tex.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. Not Fort Worth&mdash;Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Leslie, would you stand and hold up your hand, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you solemnly swear that in the testimony you are about
to give you will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Leslie, I am Albert E. Jenner, Jr., and I am a member of the
legal staff of the Warren Commission. The Warren Commission was created
pursuant to a Senate joint resolution creating the Commission to investigate
the assassination of the late President, John Fitzgerald Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. Yes, I know what it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And all the circumstances surrounding it.</p>

<p>Pursuant to that legislation, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed the
commission, of which the Honorable Earl Warren, Chief Justice of the United
States, is chairman.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that Commission has the assignment I have indicated to
you in the legislation. We are seeking on behalf of the Commission to inquire
into all pertinent facts and circumstances relating to that assassination, and
particularly to people who might or could have had any contact with or knowledge
of one Lee Harvey Oswald and his wife, Marina Oswald.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. Yes, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the course of some depositions that I have been taking here
in Dallas, mention was made by some of the witnesses of you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And possibly you might have some information. I do want
to assure you that all the references to you were in a complimentary vein and
I have sought to have this privilege of talking with you and taking your deposition,
because I think perhaps you might be helpful to us.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. I will be glad to&mdash;as much as I can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You just sit back and relax and nothing is going to happen to
you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. I don't think I know very much; actually it is very little.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, you appear voluntarily.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. Yes. Now, you want to know if I met the man and his wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Maybe I can take it by easy steps, if you will let me.</p>

<p>Mrs. Leslie, you live in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. I live here in Dallas. I can start for you from where I was
born, how I came here?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, do that, will you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. I am not young girl. I was born in Moscow in 1900. This year
on April 30, I will be 64 years old. I came to Dallas only 3 years ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 2 years ago?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. In 1960&mdash;it's only 3 years ago. I am a widow, my husband died
in 1947, whom I married&mdash;I married in 1923, so I am a widow about 17 years.</p>

<p>Here in Dallas, actually, I was going from Florida to California, but my
step-daughter, which is a daughter of my husband's first wife, asked me if I
wanted to stop here in Dallas and maybe we can live together. So, I did and
I arrived Dallas and I bought a house, so I settled here and on Hanover Street.
It is my own house, in my name, and where I met a few Russians here, but
deep regret&mdash;there was not a real Russian church, which I miss very much.
It is in English language which certainly is not the same as your own language,
the church has to be a Russian church on Newton Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On what street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. On Newton Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that St. Nicholas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. No, St. Seraphim.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The sermon is preached in English, is it not, at St. Seraphim?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. In English&mdash;Father Dimitri is preaching there. By the way,
Father Dimitri christened the daughter of this Oswald. His wife came there to
christen the daughter June, I heard.</p>

<p>Now, I was introduced to a few Russian people here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you came here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. Yes; my daughter, she was here, and she is a ballerina and she
was visiting Dallas a few times and she knew some people here. She is a ballerina&mdash;a
dancer. She met here many people&mdash;mostly connected with ballet,
artists, so she introduced me to the Voshinins, that's Igor and Natalia Voshinin,
and then she introduced me to Mr. and Mrs. Ford.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To Mr. and Mrs. Declan Ford?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. Declan Ford and then to the Mellers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The Mellers, M-e-l-l-e-r [spelling]?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. Yes; and then George Bouhe, and I think there are some Russians
in Fort Worth&mdash;those Fort Worth Russians&mdash;the Clarks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Max Clark&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Max Clark?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. Those are all the Russians which I knew here.</p>

<p>Now, I don't remember which year it was, it seemed to me it was in 1961,
when George Bouhe called me on telephone and told me there was one couple, a
young couple came from Soviet Union and if I am interested to hear something
about there, you know, the conditions in Soviet Union, he invites me to his house
to meet them. He invited them and a few Russian people all interested in the
conditions in the Soviet Union, which I left in 1924, and never corresponded
with my own mother since that, and my own sisters. I don't know what happened
to them, but I lost completely all trace of my own blood family. I never
wrote them, because I was advised not to contact them, so I went to this George
Bouhe's apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, Mrs. Leslie, the Oswalds returned from Russia on the 12th
of June 1962.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. 1962&mdash;so, it was in 1962. As I said, I am not sure which year
it was&mdash;it was so long ago. Since that I have never seen him&mdash;I just have seen
them once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was a meeting at George Bouhe's house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. At George Bouhe's house&mdash;where he lives&mdash;I could be wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it during the daytime or the evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. No, sir; it was in the daytime, you know, but I don't know
exactly&mdash;I can't mention what hour it was, but it was in some entertainment,
you know, some wine and a few things, and there was this couple with their
baby, which was Oswald and his wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who was there in addition to yourself and Mr. Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. Mrs. Meller. From there we went to Mrs. Meller's house for
dinner, so I presume it was something&mdash;3 o'clock or 4 o'clock that we were over
at Mr. Bouhe's place, and then we went to Mrs. Meller's place for dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And who was present on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. There was a few people which I didn't know actually, I tell you&mdash;when
I was introduced to Oswald&mdash;I didn't catch his name, his last name. They
called them Lee and Marina, you know, and he didn't impress me very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us about that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. Yes&mdash;he didn't impress me, you know, but the only thing&mdash;the
only one thing impressed me&mdash;he was talking quite fluently Russian language.
He was making some mistakes, grammar mistakes, in very good Russian language,
because I was born there and raised there, but he was talking fluently.
Everything he was talking in Russian language, but sometimes he was&mdash;he didn't
use grammar things or something, he wasn't quite good in grammar. I think
he was doing some mistakes, not in pronunciation but in grammar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What about Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. Marina impressed me as not so like people was saying&mdash;they have
an education or something, she was quite wise and she was a pharmacist. I
think as I understood after, she was a pharmacist, I think I understood after
from some Russian, she took course of pharmacy and was working in Leningrad
as a pharmacist, you know, so I will tell you&mdash;this Mr. Bouhe, he is a very
kind man. He always liked to help everybody he can. So, he was born also
in&mdash;Petrograd, before the Russian revolution it was, and she was born there,
and when he heard she's from his hometown, that's why he took such an interest
in this couple. He wanted to help them.</p>

<p>Now, she impressed me as a wise person, for her age, you know, and she was
talking very good Russian language, which I rarely ever heard even on television,
you know, sometimes when there was some talk of Ambassadors. It was
a different language they use now&mdash;so many new words which I do not recall
in our language. She was talking nice Russian language and that's all I
remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she speak good grammatically?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. Yes, she probably finished school, you know, there is a different
systems of school and a special course of pharmacy because she knew all terms,
the Latin terms&mdash;something that not many people know, because she was educated
in this field.</p>

<p>Then, we went to dinner and she had the trouble there with her baby,
you know, changing diapers and so on like always, but this first baby it was.
It wasn't the second baby then.</p>

<p>Then, I never met them&mdash;sometimes I was getting calls&mdash;how was this Russian
couple getting along, and they tried to find for them new work for him&mdash;he
was not satisfied with what he was doing. I think too little and always not
enough money and Bouhe was trying to help them financially.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Bouhe solicited money from you and others?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. No, I didn't give. He was just helping because he is a quite
wealthy man. He is alone and he doesn't have any limitation or anything. He
always takes interest in some poor people. He sends money and he is supporting
some old people. I do not know exactly which they are and so on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This interest of Mr. Bouhe, and this course of conduct that you
have related was, as far as you are concerned, there was nothing extraordinary
about it, it was something you normally would expect of a man like George
Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. Yes, and I will tell you now, even now I do not meet with Mr.
Bouhe and there is a completely different reason why. He is a temperate man,
a little bit&mdash;he can tell you&mdash;insult you sometimes without thinking, and I am
a little bit older than he is, a few years, so it was a case which probably will
interest you because it was one of the finest things which happens.</p>

<p>When I was a child and close with my mother, I saw a photograph of my
mother which was taken by some artist that was collecting Russian costumes
of art, you know, peasant's costumes and her brother was in an academy, he
was a painter, and this painter came from London and he wanted to help to
make a book about Russia as an artist. So, he wanted to take photographs
of the girls in these costumes and my mother was pretty, very pretty when she
was young. She was 17 then&mdash;she was very pretty then, but that was long ago,
that was 70 years ago, so they took her photograph in the costume and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
I was 5 years old, I sold this photograph to a man, nothing else, you know,
just a photographer and I forgot about it, and already being in America, I was
living in Boston with my husband. I visited one of my friends and she was
collecting Russian things, embroideries and books and she showed me some
books and it was art books and I was looking at those costumes and then I
see a portrait of my mother.</p>

<p>It was, you know, very big thing for me because being already 13 years out
of Russia and I find a portrait of my mother in America and it was a very rare
case.</p>

<p>I was asking this lady to give me the name of this book so I could find it, and
she put this book so well on the shelf and after a few years finally, she sends
me the name of this book, and when I met Mr. Bouhe, I told him I would like
to buy a book, which is a very old edition, maybe 60 years ago, which now
probably they wouldn't make it any more. He said, "That's what I like to do.
I like to do everything. I don't have too much to do," and you know, he has
nothing much to do and he says that he will find it. Finally, he found these two
books, one for $60 and one for $20. So, I said, "I don't care about the book,
I care only about my mother, the picture of my mother. I will pay for it
$20." And, at 7 o'clock in the morning he calls me and he says, "I have this
book&mdash;or rather it has arrived. Which one is portrait of your mother?"</p>

<p>There were about 20 portraits of different girls in costumes and how can I
tell him which one is my mother and I said, "You bring me book and I will show
you. I cannot tell you."</p>

<p>And he said, "Oh, how can you not tell about your mother, how she looks and
so forth?'</p>

<p>I said, "I cannot tell you. Come and I will show you, and why do you call
me at 7 o'clock in the morning. I have to rush to my job and I have no time
to talk now." So, he hung up. Then, in the evening I found the book in the
threshold of the house. So, indeed, after my job I called him on the telephone
and I told him, I wanted to thank him for it and ask him, "Why didn't you
come in the evening so I can show you where is my mother?" And he told me,
"I don't want to know you any more. You were so rude to me, you didn't want
to tell me which one is your mother so I don't want to know you any more and
I am not interested in it." I said, "That's your privilege. I cannot force myself
on you, if you don't want to know me." So, that was a break, you know, so
since that&mdash;it was about more than 1 year I have lost track of it.</p>

<p>After this I was not at his house. So, I meet him socially sometimes at Mrs.
Ford's house and shake hands with him, but I not invite him. He says he
doesn't want me to know him&mdash;he doesn't want to know me, so I do not invite
him to my house, he does not invite me to his house; and that's the situation,
and I didn't meet him since&mdash;since this case, but I have nothing against him,
but I was expecting from him some apology. I am an older woman and, after
all, he is a man and I am a lady and when he told me he doesn't want to know
me, so that's his, you know, duty to excuse me. I was a little bit rough, or
something, and that's the end, but he didn't, so I'm stubborn too, so that was
the end with Mr. Bouhe, and I never met him one time, and when I meet him,
I say, "Hello, how are you," and that's all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did these people, Lee Oswald and Marina Oswald act toward
each other on the occasion when you saw them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. I will tell you something&mdash;I don't know if Bouhe told you or
others too. When she was out at a place&mdash;she had a black eye and she has
her tooth out, one tooth was out, so a second man it was raised a question how
she had this black eye and so on, and she said, "Oh, I hit the kitchen door.
The baby was crying and I didn't want to make a light, the door was open and
I hit it&mdash;the kitchen door."</p>

<p>And then, later, I heard from Mrs. Meller that he beat her, he was beating
her, that he was always beating her and everybody was sympathetic with her.
Frankly now, it is understandable. She was Russian, you know, it is some
kind of a feeling of a Russian toward a Russian and they were mad at him
and how he could beat his wife&mdash;this is not proper&mdash;to beat his wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, now, we don't approve of that in America.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. No. All I say now is what other people like Mellers and like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
Fords told me that once he beat her so hard and threw her out in the street,
so she took her baby as a result in just a little blanket&mdash;she didn't know where
to go and she came to Mellers and she said, "I don't know where to go," that
she wasn't talking good English and he wanted to talk Russian at home, so she
didn't know what to do and the Mellers are very nice people, so they took her
in their house and she stayed there a few days until they found a place for
her. I don't remember, but they said, "Oh, the awful things," and they took
her&mdash;I think, you know, that she was staying with them.</p>

<p>I didn't know she was staying with Fords. I didn't know when, because
I lost trace of her and so that's all I know about Oswalds. Actually, I didn't
see her until when she was on television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I want to ask you about a certain George De Mohrenschildt.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. I do not know him very much, he is a friend of my daughter's
and he is in Haiti.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; I know that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. And he was patronizing Oswalds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What kind of fellow was George De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. You know, my daughter is ballerina and so even I have pictures
somewhere with her. He was taking her out, you know, courting her. She
is a very beautiful girl, my daughter&mdash;Nattialie Krassooska of the stage, and
she is a very, very attractive girl and a very prima ballerina many, many years
and he was courting her. They were going together, swimming together, and
I don't know where&mdash;that's why she invited me to come here. She said, "I have
here some friends," but when I came, he already married this Jeanne.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Jeanne?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. She's Russian&mdash;I don't know her maiden name, Jeanne or
Jane or something in Russian, but I could not tell what her maiden name is
and he was married four times and she was married, I don't know, a few times,
and then they took this trip, a walking trip in South America or somewhere, you
know, they walked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From the Mexican border down to Panama?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. I don't know exactly, so they was walking and what were the
arrangements he made&mdash;with some Life Magazine, or something, but he is a
geologist anyway. She took this job in Haiti also make geologist, and when I
came here he already was married, but it happens like so, once he lost his little
boy from another wife and he was very much grieving about this boy, so my
daughter, being his friend, she sympathizes with him and wrote him a little
letter. She wrote him a letter of sympathy because he lost his little boy and
then his wife, Jeanne, called my daughter and said that they was not meeting
since he was married and she said she would like to meet her and since then,
occasionally, we was meeting them at Fords and other houses and then once
at Christmas time she invited them to come to our house, so they were once
at our house. Now, I didn't know them before and I will tell you something&mdash;that
what many people were afraid of, his wife is atheist. She doesn't believe
in God.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is Mrs. De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. Yes&mdash;his wife, and he wasn't, when he was going with my
daughter, which is very religious, he was going to church, even singing in
chorus of church. After he married this Jeanne he became atheist too, you
know, so I don't know&mdash;maybe he always is under the influence of somebody,
but it is hard to tell, but I cannot judge them. I don't know how to judge the
characters that they are, but everybody says, "Well, he is under influence of this
Jeanne." That's all they say about him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there anything extraordinary about him in his dress and
his attitude?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. You know, after this trip, they are very&mdash;they don't like to
dress. You can invite them for Christmas and he will come in slacks, dirty, and
in sweaters, you know, his appearance always shocked me a little bit. You know,
when you invite people for dinner, you expect them to be more or less decent
dressed, and she, too, and they was saying when they were making this trip to
Mexico or South America, or I don't know, they was walking in bikinis and
practically naked and there was dogs and a mule, and you know, so I don't know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
what kind of people&mdash;whose influence was this and was he the same before or
not, I cannot tell.</p>

<p>I never was interested in that, in this family, you know, close, so that's all
I know about De Mohrenschildts.</p>

<p>Actually, now, it's already a long time, and my daughter doesn't either. The
De Mohrenschildts are more or less friends with&mdash;and I don't know who knows
them best, but I think&mdash;whether the Mellers do or not&mdash;I don't know who is
friends, but I heard that he took interest in these Oswalds and Oswalds was in
his house many times, but what they was talking about, if he knew about his
point of view or if he knew he is a Communist, you know, many people was
thinking that probably she didn't broke with the Soviet Union when she left,
why he left, you know, why they let him out, you know, but nobody knows, you
know, it is so hard to leave from there&mdash;his wife and child, why they let them
out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Did this occur to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. It has occurred to everybody&mdash;how&mdash;he was so poor and Bouhe
was helping him and he has no decent job and at the same time he took a trip
to Mexico and he took a trip to New Orleans&mdash;he was taking these trips&mdash;who
supplied him with money&mdash;nobody knows. You know, that's a thought everybody
was thinking&mdash;how he went there and how&mdash;it's strange things, but nobody
can answer these questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But the interest of Mr. Bouhe and the Fords and the Mellers
and the De Mohrenschildts and others was an interest growing out of good
heartedness?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. I hope so&mdash;I think so&mdash;I hope so. Mostly, you know, I cannot
tell about De Mohrenschildts. She's Russian and he is Russian. I don't know&mdash;he's
from Estonia or something, you know, De Mohrenschildt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the Baltic Sea?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. Yes; but she is Russian. Now, you know, it is natural that
Russians wants to meet Russians to talk their own language, and not to forget
it, so they met them somewhere and invited them to their place, and if they
helped them, I don't know, but they met, which I know&mdash;they was meeting them&mdash;somebody
told that the FBI was looking for De Mohrenschildt here, and I
think they found he was in Haiti, and I think in 6 months he will come back
and it will all be over, after this is over. Probably he will come back into
the United States.</p>

<p>Now, I cannot tell any more. Yes&mdash;I wanted to tell this&mdash;so, when this
naturally occurred, I was watching television because President Kennedy was
coming to Dallas and, the man, you know, he was nice, and there was Mrs. Kennedy,
the First Lady, and then there was a bullet and a shot and he was shot and
later they show a picture of Oswald. They presume that it was Oswald who is
killer, you know, and I look at this Oswald, and then they showed Marina with
the child and I did not recognize her; you know, I have not seen them in a couple
of years and I didn't know his last name, the name Lee and Marina didn't meant
to me everything, and then they said "Russian born," but didn't occur to me that
I met them, and then I went to church on Newton Street and then there was a
friend of mine, Igor Voshinin and Natalia Voshinin and she said, "Did you hear
who killed President Kennedy?" I said, "I don't remember his name. They
named it on television but I don't remember his name."</p>

<p>They said, "It's Oswald, you know him." I said, "I know him?" And they
said, "But yes; you met him." I said, "Well," and then I said, "Oh, yes; I met
him." And then I stopped to look at the pictures more closely and I recognized
him then, but at first even I didn't recognize him, because when you are not
expecting&mdash;I didn't know his last name and such a common face he has, and such
a&mdash;you couldn't remember his face very closely&mdash;it is just one person you can
recognize him, and that's how it happened that I knew him and his wife. Oh,
I feel so bad; I shaked his hand&mdash;I didn't remember if I did or not. I shaked his
hand, and I said, "Oh, I shaked hands with the killer of the President," and I
felt dirty and I touched something I didn't want to touch, you know, but actually
I'm very sorry about Marina, his wife. I am sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you seen her since the occasion you met her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. No, no; I think she is now helped by Mr. and Mrs. Ford. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
correct that they was helping her because she received so much from the donations
and money, and somebody took advantage of it and they was providing her
money and she could not get for herself anything and they was investing it or
something&mdash;I don't know the situation, but she is now&mdash;they asked her&mdash;as
Russian&mdash;to watch over her. I don't know what she does&mdash;I never meet with
her; I never invited Marina Oswald to my house and I do not intend to. I just
don't want to&mdash;I don't know, but, you know, I have such a feeling that it is better
to&mdash;I don't know, maybe I am wrong and have to be more Christian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, Mrs. Leslie, we appreciate very much your coming in, I
know, at an inconvenience to you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. But if I can help with something I want to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were helpful to us and we appreciate it very much.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Miss Oliver will write this up and if you wish to read it, you
have that liberty and that right to do so, and if you would prefer to do that, we
will make your transcript available to you to read.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. Yes; you will mail it to me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If you call in here to Mr. Barefoot Sanders, the U.S. attorney's
office, he will have it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. I have to write his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he will know when your transcript is ready.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. He will call me on the telephone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had better call him because there are so many witnesses.
Call him sometime next week and then you may come in and read it and sign it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. Yes; I will be glad to because everything I told, I told it under
oath and it is completely true and I didn't try to hide anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. That's the name and the phone number.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. Sir, I will call him and ask him&mdash;what I have to ask&mdash;is my
deposition ready?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If the writeup of your deposition is ready for you to read?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. To read&mdash;all right; thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You give him your name and he will tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Let me give you another name to call since Mr. Sanders may be
hard to get. You might call Martha Joe Stroud, who is an assistant attorney
here and she is actually in charge of those, and she might be the one you could
reach and she would be at this same number.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. All right; I will do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I would say about Tuesday or Wednesday of next week. Thank
you so much, Mrs. Leslie.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Leslie</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>I am Albert E. Jenner, Jr., member of the legal staff of the Commission,
and have prepared to make inquiry of you with respect to the subject matter
with which the Commission is charged.</p>

<p>In general, as you have noted from the documents enclosed with Mr. Rankin's
letter, the Commission is charged with the investigation and the assembling
of facts respecting the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on the 22d
of November 1963, the events that followed that assassination, and all matters
before and after that are deemed by the Commission relevant to its obligations.</p>

<p>In pursuing these lines of inquiry, which we have been doing now for some
months, we have examined before the Commission and by way of deposition
various people who, by pure happenstance in the course of their lives, came into
contact either with Lee Harvey Oswald or Marina Oswald, or others who had
some relation with them. And in the course of our investigation, we have
learned that you and Mrs. De Mohrenschildt befriended the Oswalds at one
time, and had some other contact with them.</p>

<p>As you realize, there are rumors and speculations of various people who do
not know what the facts are&mdash;some of them know bits of the facts&mdash;which
require us in many instances to inquire into matters that are largely personal.
We are not doing so merely because we are curious.</p>

<p>I will confine myself to matters that we believe to be relevant. It may not
always be apparent to you, because we know a great deal more, of course,
than any one witness would know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. You know, this affair actually is hurting me quite
a lot, particularly right now in Haiti, because President Duvalier&mdash;I have a
contract with the Government.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; I want to inquire on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. They got wind I am called by the Warren committee.
Nobody knows how it happened. And now he associates me, being very scared
of assassination, with a staff of international assassins, and I am about to be
expelled from the country. My contract may be broken.</p>

<p>So I discussed that with our Ambassador there, Mr. Timmons, and he said,
of course, it sounds ridiculous, but he will try to do his best.</p>

<p>Supposedly, President Duvalier received a letter from Washington. Now,
this is unofficial&mdash;one of the ministers informed me of that&mdash;in which this letter
states that I was a very close friend of Oswald's, that I am a Polish Communist
and a member of an international band.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I would say that you are misinformed on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, he did receive some kind of a letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But nothing that would contain any such statements.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I don't know from whom. Some kind of a
letter he received from someone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It may have been a crank letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It may have been a crank letter, but nothing official.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I am sure it is nothing official. I am sure it
could not have been anything official.</p>

<p>I hope Mr. Timmons will investigate it. Because, naturally, the Minister of
Finance of Haiti tells me that it is an official letter and seems to indicate that
it comes from the FBI. But I just doubt it, personally. Probably a crank letter.
I do not have an extraordinary admiration for the FBI. But, frankly, I don't
think they would do anything like that, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They don't go around making <span class="locked">official&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. So I hope that this unpleasantness will be somehow
repaired by Mr. Timmons. And I think that just a communication from him
to the foreign office there might help. I am not persona non grata at the
Embassy. He doesn't have to swear I am this or that, or that I am a good
friend of his. But just that I am not persona non grata would be sufficient, I
think. Because this job I have there in Haiti is a result of many years of work,
preparation, and it is important for me. It involves a considerable amount of
money, $285,000, and further development, mining and oil development, which
goes with it&mdash;and preparation of this job started already in 1947, when I first
came to Haiti, and went several times subsequently and worked there. It is a
long-term approach that I have started, because I like the country, and I think
it has excellent oil possibilities, and I finally got that contract about in March
last year.</p>

<p>So if the committee could do something in that respect&mdash;I am going also to
see a gentleman in the State Department who Mr. Timmons suggested me to see
and explain the situation to him. It would be very unpleasant, just to be
kicked out of the country because of the rumors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, we certainly don't want that to happen. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Please think about what can be done in this respect,
because it is really very important to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. And excuse me. I am also employing American
geologists there, and I am responsible for them and their families. I have several
Haitian engineers and geologists working there. So it is not a fly-by-night
project, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I don't regard it as such, and I know something about it.
I think probably it would be well if we start from the beginning. You were
born in 1911?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Some of the reports say April 17th and some say April 4th, or
something of that nature. It is probably a difference in the calendar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is it exactly. It is a difference in calendar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is April 17, 1911, by what calendar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. By our calendar here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what date <span class="locked">by&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. April 4th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And by what calendar is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. By the Gregorian Calendar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In any event, you are now 53 years old?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. A town called Mozyr.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What country?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Russia; Czarist Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Czarist, did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, some of the reports indicate that this was Poland rather
than Russia. Would you explain this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I don't remember the town, because I never
lived there to my memory. But it is not too far from the Polish border.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, your father was Sergis Alexander Von Mohrenschildt, is
that correct? And your mother was Alexandra Zopalsky?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What nationality was your mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. My mother was Russian, of Polish and Hungarian
descent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the nationality of your father?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He was also of Russian, Swedish, German descent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you tell me a little bit about your father? And may I
say this. There appear in the reports that he was&mdash;or maybe your grandfather,
was Swedish, or someone in your line was Swedish, and received some commission
or grant from the Queen of Sweden at one time, or maybe your family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us about that, will you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, the family is of Swedish origin. The name
is spelled M-o-h-r-e-n-s-k-u-l-d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; I saw last night in looking over these materials the spelling
S-k-o-l-d-t, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right, it is spelled this way. That is a
Swedish way of spelling. And the letter "o" with two dots over it is a typical
Swedish letter which cannot be translated or written down in any language.
So in probably moving to Russia, or to the Baltic States, you see, which was
an intermediary area between Russia and Sweden, they probably changed it to
S-c-h-i-l-d-t. And it can also be written in Russian, at the same time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, what did your father do? What was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He was a landowner. He was a director of the
Nobel interests for a while. He was a marshal of nobility of the Minsk Province.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Marshal of nobility. He was elected representative
of the landowners to the Government.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of what country?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Of Czarist Russia. He was born in Russia, and
spent all his life in Russia, spoke German at home sometimes, sometimes Russian.
That was a mixed-up family, of which there were so many in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You, yourself, have the command of at least four, maybe five
languages. May I see if I can recall them. English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; if you consider it a command.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; I do. German?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. German, not too well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Spanish?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Spanish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. French?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Russian; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And I suppose a smattering of a number of other languages.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have traveled widely?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Especially in Europe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Now you can add Creole to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From your experience in Haiti?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right. And Yugoslav.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; you spent almost a year in Yugoslavia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you pick up any Danish when you were there, or do they
speak French there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. They speak German and French.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your father is deceased?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What do you know about his death?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. My father <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think it might be well, Mr. De Mohrenschildt&mdash;I am trying to
make this informal. I want you to relax.</p>

<p>May I say, because of the considerations about which you are concerned, I
will tend to inquire into these things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I am very glad that you do, because you know what
I mean&mdash;it is probably being in a controversial business like I am, international
<span class="locked">business&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Also, I gather that you are a pretty lively character.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Maybe so. I hope so. All sorts of speculation have
arisen from time to time. And I don't mind, frankly, because when you don't
have anything to hide, you see, you are not afraid of anything. I am very
outspoken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I understand that you are, from witnesses I have interviewed,
and from these mountains of reports.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I can imagine. By the way, those reports&mdash;again,
you see this inquiry is probably going to hurt my business. I hope they
are conducted somehow delicately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I was asking you to tell me about your father.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Up to the time of his death, from what you understand to be
the circumstances of death.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; well, my father, then, therefore, was an important
official of the Czarist government. But he was a liberal&mdash;he had very
liberal ideas. He, for instance, <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, liberal, to me, over in that country would mean nothing.
You tell us what you mean by that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Liberal means disliked anti-Semitism, the persecution
of Jews.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was opposed to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Opposed to that. Disliked the oppression, some
elements of oppression of the Czarist government.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was opposed to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Opposed to that. And preached constitutional government.
During the war he was a member&mdash;being an official&mdash;member of the
group which mobilized the Army, and all that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He mobilized the Czarist army?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are talking now about World War I?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. World War I. It is such a long time ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I have to get these things on record, so that somebody who is
reading this, Mr. De Mohrenschildt, a hundred years from now&mdash;I should tell
you that your testimony will be reproduced in full just as you give it, with all
my questions put to you just as I put them. And it will be printed as part of
the report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I can imagine what a volume it will be for the future
Ph. D.'s to study. This is vague in my memory. I am saying what I vaguely
remember, because, at that time, I was 5 years old. But I vaguely remember
those days, the objections of my father against the Czarist government to a
degree, although he was an official. He was an independent character, too.
Finally he resigned his marshal of nobility position, and became a director of
Nobel interests, of which his older brother was a president or chairman of the
board&mdash;I don't know, I don't remember any more, in Baku, Russia. So we spent
a little time there&mdash;in the oil fields. And then, of course, the revolution came.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that came when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Beg pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. 1918, I guess. Then the revolution came. We were
returned to Minsk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In 1918 where were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In 1918 probably in St. Petersburg, or Moscow, one
or the other&mdash;in both towns at some times. Because the headquarters of that
Nobel enterprises were in Petersburg or Moscow. But I am not so sure about
that. Anyway, we lived there for awhile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You do have a personal recollection of having lived in St. Petersburg
and Moscow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, very vague. I never expected you to ask me
such questions. I really have to delve into my memory. It is not very difficult,
because, you know, I like to write things. So I did write a story of my childhood,
and it is called "Child of the Revolution," a memory of the child of the
revolution. It was poorly written. I showed it to one of the editors, Scribners,
I remember, and they wanted me to change it, and I abandoned the whole thing.
Well, so I do have a little bit more recollection than I am supposed to have just
by living so many years, because I did write it down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. You wrote it when you came over to this country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you refreshed your recollection at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Discussions with your brother, I suppose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you have mentioned Minsk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That was the province where my father was governor&mdash;not
governor, but marshal of nobility of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What province is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Province of Minsk. Surprisingly, that is where Lee
Oswald lived. This is one of the reasons I was curious about his experiences,
because I remember it very well. I remember that town very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What age were you when you left Minsk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. So from Leningrad, during the occupation by the
Germans of Minsk, you see, we escaped from the Communists in Leningrad, and
moved to Minsk back again, because it was German occupied.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was in World War I?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, in World War I. That was in 1918 or 1919. I
don't remember exactly what year it was. That area was still occupied by the
Germans. Anyway, there was famine in Moscow, or Leningrad, I don't remember
which one&mdash;-there was famine there. So we escaped.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your whole family escape to Minsk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't remember what my brother was doing at the
time. I think&mdash;I think just my father, mother, and myself. I think my brother
was in the Naval Academy at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I want to ask you about your brother in due course.</p>

<p>He is about 12 years older than you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes&mdash;11.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A man of some scholarly attainment, by the way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He certainly is. He loves books.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Anyway, we escaped from the famine, frankly, more
than communism, and moved back to Minsk&mdash;whether we had a house, or I don't
remember, but we had some possessions there. And we arrived there. And
from then on we stayed there, although the Communists eventually occupied
Minsk. Then my father was put in jail. I will make it short.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Please&mdash;that is all right. I don't mind the shortness. But I
want times. About when was your father put in jail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. The first time in 1920, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were still with your family then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At this time you were 9 years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your mother was still alive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your father was seized?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. By the Communists, by the Communist regime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why was he seized?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. For being outspoken, I guess. I remember&mdash;the first
time I don't remember, frankly. But the second time I remember very well,
because this is very interesting. He was seized the first time. Then the Polish
Army arrived&mdash;the Poles and the Russians were fighting at the time. And at the
last moment the Communists released my father, because of the intervention of
some friend, you see. And we always had some friends whom we had protected
once upon a time, who always came and helped him at the right moment with
the Communists, because many Jewish people he had helped became Communists,
or halfway Communists. They helped him. And that is how eventually
we were able to escape from Soviet Russia.</p>

<p>The first time he was released, the Poles arrived, we were in Poland again,
that was a temporary occupation. And then the Poles retreated and the Russians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
arrived again. And here was the question to decide whether we should
go with the Poles or stay in Russia. And my father decided to stay in Russia
because being a liberal he had an impression that they have changed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That the Russians had changed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; he heard from somebody that they have become
liberal. He stayed in Minsk, and because he stayed he got some kind of
an appointment in the Soviet Government. I don't remember which one it was.
I guess in the Department of Agriculture, because he was interested in division
of big estates. That was his idea&mdash;what was going on in Russia was opposed
by the huge estates. We had one, also, but not as big. So he was always
in favor of the division of the big estates, breaking them up into smaller farms.
And he had this appointment, adviser to the Minister of Agriculture&mdash;I don't
remember what it was exactly. And we lived more or less happily for a certain
number of months&mdash;although there was a famine there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you are still in Minsk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Still in Minsk; yes&mdash;in probably 1920. And then
one day they arrested him again. And here is what happened. I will show you
what kind of a person he was. At the time they were installing museums in
churches. And my father objected to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your father was a religious man, was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; he was not religious. But he objected by principle
to that. He was not very religious at all. But he objected to the intervention
into other people's faith. We never had too much religion in the
family. And he was put in jail. And started criticizing the Soviet Government.
And, finally&mdash;I remember this more distinctly&mdash;because he was finally
sentenced to life exile to Siberia. And that I will never forget about my father&mdash;an
interesting thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was banished to Siberia by the Russians?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. These are the Bolsheviks who had conducted the revolution.
This was a revolutionary period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right. This is 1921 by now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are now 10 years old?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I remained on the street making my own living somehow.
My mother runs around the country trying to save my father. He is in
jail for the second time, and finally he gets sentenced to life imprisonment in
a town called Vieliki Ustug in Siberia. This is as far as I remember the name
of it.</p>

<p>And why was he sentenced for that&mdash;because at the hearing, whatever they
called the court, they asked him, "What kind of government do you suggest for
Soviet Russia?" And he said, fool as he was, "Constitutional monarchy," and
that was it. That was his sentence&mdash;just because of that. Because, actually,
they didn't have anything against him. My father was a liberal and never hurt
anybody. He became very sick in jail. And these friends&mdash;the friends whom
he had helped <span class="locked">previously&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean true friends?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right. In this particular case I don't remember
their names. They were a couple of Jewish doctors who advised my
father to eat as little as possible, any way to appear very sick, and finally&mdash;they
themselves were his doctors. They finally made the position with the
Soviet Government that he was going to die, he was not going to survive the
trip to Siberia, because he was going to be sent directly to Siberia, with the
family, with all of us. And that he should be released to stay home, and just
appear once&mdash;a couple of times a week to show he is there, until his health
condition improved, and he was able to be sent to Siberia.</p>

<p>And they did that, surprisingly, and they released him. And that is where
he made his preparations for escape. And the same people, helped him to get
some transportation, a hay wagon, and we crossed the border, in a very long
and tedious way. But we crossed the border of Poland.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You crossed the border into Poland, and he settled where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In a town called Wilno.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was yourself, your mother, and your father?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. My father. But my mother almost immediately
died from typhoid fever which she contracted during this escape. We all had
this typhoid fever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But she succumbed to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this was what year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. 1922.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are now 11 years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At this point I might ask you&mdash;the name was Von Mohrenschildt
at this particular time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your name is now De Mohrenschildt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think your brother still uses the Von, does he not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you explain that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes&mdash;because I am more or less of a French orientation.
And when I became an American citizen, I did not like the prefix "Von"
which is German to the average person. And so we used "De" which is equally
used in Sweden or in the Baltic States, interchangeably. And my uncle, who was
here in the States for quite some time, and died <span class="locked">here&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I was going to ask you about him. You might as well give his
full name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Ferdinand De Mohrenschildt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will digress for a moment. Ferdinand De Mohrenschildt was
some officer, or had a connection with the Russian Embassy here in Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us about that, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, he was First Secretary of the Czarist Embassy,
the last Czarist Embassy here in Washington. He married McAdoo's daughter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. William Gibbs McAdoo's daughter. She is now Mrs. Post.</p>

<p>Is she still alive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; she is still alive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall her first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Nona.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your uncle is deceased?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He is deceased; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They were eventually divorced, were they not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, sir; no&mdash;he died. They were never divorced.
She was divorced many times&mdash;remarried and divorced many times. But he
died&mdash;I guess in 1925 or 1924.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Sometimes people refer to you as Baron De Mohrenschildt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you explain that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't refer to myself as that, you know. But supposedly
the family has the right to it, because we are members of the Baltic
nobility.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Through what source?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Through the Swedish source, from the time of Queen
Christina. But my father never used the title, because of his perhaps liberal
tendencies. Neither did Ferdinand, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And as near as I can tell, your brother never has?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. My brother&mdash;I don't think so; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At least I don't find it in any of the papers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are an interesting person, Mr. De Mohrenschildt, to many
people. They have gathered ideas about you, and many of them in the past
at least have felt that you might have been, or that you perhaps were&mdash;had a
title of some kind. I just wanted to explain that of record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, we have you in Wilno, Poland. You are 11 years old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I have some papers which say that we are barons,
in my files. But, frankly, I don't&mdash;I think it is sort of ridiculous to use the title.
My ex-wife loved the idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. The very last one, Sharples.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Am I correct that there were two children, yourself and your
brother Dimitri?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And no others&mdash;just two children?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you stayed in Wilno, Poland, how long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Stayed in Wilno until I graduated from gymnasium,
which is the equivalent of high school. A little bit more than a high school.
That must have been 1929. Not constantly over there, but that is where our
home was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did your father do in Wilno?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In Wilno he fought for the&mdash;tried to regain back
our estate. It happened to be we had an estate, a piece of land.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In Russia&mdash;which became Poland&mdash;in Czarist Russia,
but which became Poland. Right on the border. It became through the partition
of Czarist Russia, it became part of Poland. And this estate was in Poliesie.
That is a wooded area of Poland, right on the border.</p>

<p>Well, the estate was seized by the peasants and divided among themselves
by themselves. It was not large, but it was&mdash;well, maybe 5,000 acres; 5,000
or 6,000 acres.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I would say that is fairly large.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. My father was able to regain it. He did not take
it back from the peasants, but he regained ownership and was able to sell the
forests from it, and eventually sold it back again to the peasants piece by piece.
So we were not completely penniless refugees.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your mother have an interest in that estate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, it was mother's and father's estate, probably
jointly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, you completed your classical intermediate education, as you call the
gymnasium, in 1929.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So you are now 18 years sf age?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your mother is deceased. Did you live with your father during
this period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Very close relationship I had with my father.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, did you then leave Poland?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No. Then I tried to&mdash;I did not like the country very
much, Poland. We became Polish citizens, but I didn't particularly feel at
home there. I learned the language. But it didn't feel like home. And I
decided to go to study in Belgium, and asked for permission to go to Belgium,
and the Polish Government refused me the permission because I was close to
the military age. So I volunteered for the Polish Army.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I would like to go into that. Go right ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I volunteered for the Polish Army and chose the
cavalry and was sent to the military academy in Grudziondz. Well, it was a
famous military academy in Poland where the Polish nobility displayed their
ability to ride horseback. And I was able to get to it because I volunteered&mdash;I
was 18 years old. I graduated from there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. May I ask you this; Would it have been possible
for any young man your age at that time, let's say, if I may use a reference,
peasant, which you were not, to have volunteered for the same position or
division in the Polish Army?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. There were some exceptions. Most of the people
there were members of the aristocracy, Polish aristocracy, and German aristocracy,
who happened to have estates in Poland. But we had some exceptions.
But they did not survive later on. They were eliminated, not because of the
snobbishness, but it was a pretty tough training, and you needed money to be
in that school. You had to have a uniform, you have to have your own horse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, where did you get the funds to finance it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, my father had this estate, sales of land from
that estate, and he also was&mdash;now, this I forgot to mention about my father.
He started originally as a professor in the gymnasium, then became a government
official with the Czarist government. So he was always&mdash;always liked
to teach.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are taking us back to Russia for a moment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Back to Russia for a moment; yes. So now his
profession as a government official was no good&mdash;neither his experience as a
director of Nobel Enterprises was not much good. So he became a professor
and a director of the gymnasium, the Russian gymnasium.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is the high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. High school, in Wilno. You know&mdash;where the immigrants
send their children. And he was director of it for a number of years.
I don't remember what exact years. I guess until 1929 or 1930. I didn't go
to the same school, by the way. I went to a different school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean you went to a school different from the one in which
he was teaching?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; in order not to be under my father's&mdash;not
supervision, but also that school did not give the rights in Poland, by the way&mdash;did
not have the rights in Poland to go to a university in Poland or to serve
a short military term, because it was a refugee school, conducted in the Russian
language. So I went to a Polish school, had to learn the Polish language, and
finally graduated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did I mention Polish as one of the languages of which you have
a command?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. And, therefore, it was very important, because
the military service for the people graduating from nonaccepted schools was
4 years, or something like that, and for the ones who graduated from the official
school it was, I think, a year and a half.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, how long were you in the military academy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. A year and a half.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this would take us, then, to the middle of 1931.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. 1931; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you had reached what, if any, rank in the military service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I reached candidate officer&mdash;sergeant candidate officer,
an intermediate rank between an officer and noncommissioned officer. The
highest you can get after you get from the military academy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just before as in this country you are about to be commissioned
a second lieutenant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right. Except that you are not completely
a soldier&mdash;you are not a noncommissioned officer, you are not a commissioned
officer. You are about to be commissioned a lieutenant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. All right. Now, you didn't pursue that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No, no. It was just a reserve. You see, it gives
you a reserve rank which you can pursue by going back to maneuvers, and
pursue that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, there are some indications that you did return.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, tell me what you did in that connection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I went to school, then to Belgium&mdash;I was free
now to go to school to Belgium. And I went to Institut Superieur de Commerce
a Anvers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The translation of that is the institute of higher commercial
studies, Antwerp, Belgium. When attending the institution of higher commercial
studies in Antwerp, you returned to Poland, did you, from time to time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In connection with your summer maneuvers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what was the requirement in that connection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Just to come there when they called you, and go with
the Army&mdash;summer maneuvers, summer exercises. I think I did that twice.
I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this was still in the cavalry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Still in the cavalry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you ultimately commissioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; always stayed a sergeant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You entered the institute <span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. By the way, which was a commission&mdash;that is very
hard to explain to you. It is like midshipman in the Navy. That is what it is.
And since I did not pursue the military career, I remained a candidate officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I was not disqualified for any reason. On the contrary,
I was the best actually, if I may say so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Let me pass for a moment in this connection so we can get it on
the record here&mdash;your brother, Dimitri, 11 years older than you, he also devoted
his time to the service, but to the Navy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, that was the Russian Czarist Navy, was it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And tell us about that, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, he joined the naval academy when I think
he was 11 or 12 years old. That is what they have out there. They start very
young. Do you want a little bit of the background of my brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, sir; go right ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He is really a ferocious anti-Communist, so you
would be very happy to hear about that. He was in the Russian Imperial Navy,
became a midshipman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Give me some dates.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, he was a midshipman in 1918, in Sebastopol,
which is the headquarters there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, he was born March 29, 1902, in St. Petersburg, Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. I thought he was born in 1900.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, his records at the passport office give his birth as March 29,
1902, and he gives his birth in his biographical material at Dartmouth and Yale.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, anyway, he was a young edition of a midshipman.
He was a midshipman in 1918, which is like graduation from Annapolis
here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did he actually serve in the Czarist Navy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. All the time you are in that school you are in the
navy, all the time&mdash;even when you are 12 years old, you are a member of the
navy. It is not like here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he participate in World War I, in the late 1918 period of
fighting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't recall where. He joined anti-Communist
groups, was finally caught by the Communists, and sentenced to death in a town
called Smolensk.</p>

<p>Here we were coming back to our&mdash;we were already in Minsk at the time,
that was not too far. My brother was in Smolensk in jail, in a Communist jail.
My father also in jail. And I was the only one at liberty. And my mother was
running around trying to help both of them.</p>

<p>My brother was sentenced to be shot. He was put to the wall and they told
him, "You will be shot when they say three, and they would say one, two&mdash;he
was supposed to disclose the names of his accomplices.</p>

<p>Now, I do not recall; Yes, yes. The Polish Government exchanged him against
a Communist. They made an exchange. They had some Communist prisoners,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
and my brother was with a group of Poles who were prisoners of the Communists,
and the Poles exchanged him against some of my father's old friends.
And I remember who it is. It was a Catholic bishop in Poland.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Lozinski. He was a bishop who was in jail with
my brother, also, and they wanted him, he helped my brother to get out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your brother join you in Wilno, Poland?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He immediately&mdash;it looks vague. I think he joined
us for a little while, or he maybe went ahead of us and came to the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. My information is that he emigrated to the United States on the
20th of August 1920.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. A little bit ahead of us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does that square with your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right. You see, there was an intermediate
year. The Poles had occupied part of Russia. I think we saw him just before
he departed for the United States. The Poles offered him to join the Navy in
Poland, and he decided to go to the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. I had digressed a moment because it was appropriate
to have your brother come in at the point we reached. But we have you now in
Belgium, attending the university.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had your brother had a higher education while he was still
in Russia? That is, had he gone beyond the gymnasium stage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No. My brother was a midshipman in the Navy.
He had only the naval academy education, and even shortened&mdash;short naval
academy education. I don't know what you would compare it to. Certainly
better than high school here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Junior college?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Junior college; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you continued your studies, did you, in Belgium?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you receive a degree from the institute of higher commercial
studies in Antwerp?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. I received what you called&mdash;master's degree,
probably equivalent, because they don't have bachelor's degree there. You get
immediately a master's degree&mdash;a license&mdash;in finance and in maritime transportation&mdash;another
year of maritime transportation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you attended this institute for 4 years, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. For 5 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, you <span class="locked">received&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; all the degrees you can get there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is one of the oldest commercial institutions of higher learning
in Europe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Something like the Harvard Business School?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; founded by Napoleon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you received <span class="locked">a&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It is a mixture of some engineering and commercial&mdash;not
exactly like Harvard School of Business Administration. It lets
you carry on industrial and business activities, with a specialization in maritime
transportation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There is some indication that your degree is one of master of
arts in commercial, financial, and counsular sciences.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you continued on&mdash;after you received that master's degree,
you continued on for another year, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No; you <span class="locked">entered&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I entered the University of Liege.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And how long did you study there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Two years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you ultimately received a degree, did you not?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was that degree?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Doctor of science in international commerce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you write a doctorate thesis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On what subject was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It was the subject of the economic influence of the
United States on Latin America.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you already acquired, through that, an interest in Latin
America?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have pursued that in subsequent years, have you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; a very useful dissertation it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, we have you&mdash;let's see, this is about 5 years&mdash;you are
<span class="locked">about&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. 1938.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We are up in 1938.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Now,&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In the meantime, my brother came to visit me from
the United States. We had not seen each other since 1920. He was studying&mdash;he
was pursuing his career, and eventually got married.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To Miss McAdoo?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; that is my uncle. My brother married a lady by
the name of Betty Cartright Hooker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is right. And you were in partnership at one time with
Edward Hooker, were you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will get to that in a moment. She is still living, is she not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She still is living; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is she in this country or in Paris or Italy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She is in New York now. I have her address some
place. She lives between New York and Paris.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you engage in some kind of a business in Europe during this
period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. While you were attending the university?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did you manage that while you&mdash;inasmuch as you were
pursuing your studies at two universities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I had an interest in a sport shop with a girl
friend of mine. It helped me to make ends meet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the name of that company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. The name was Sigurd.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that was devoted to what&mdash;readymade clothes, ski clothes,
and that sort of thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you attempt to sell those throughout Europe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the process of doing so, did you then travel through Europe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where did you get the funds to finance that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Very little funds&mdash;maybe a $1,000, $2,000, from my
father, and whatever savings my girl friend had. She was an excellent saleswoman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you received any funds from your mother's participation
in the estate you had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think that was the money that helped me to start&mdash;when
I was 21 years old I received a couple of thousand dollars&mdash;although
I did not take all the money away from my father, but at least part of it.
Or maybe more than that&mdash;maybe $4,000 or $5,000. I really don't recall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There is some indication in the papers that it was as much as
$10,000.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Maybe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You just don't <span class="locked">have&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It was a very successful operation, this business,
Sigurd.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you subsequently dissolve it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Dissolved it, quarreled with my girl friend, decided
to come to the States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your brother had been over to see you in the meantime?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; and that is what, by the way, induced me into
coming to the States, because my brother and his wife came to meet me. They
sort of were not too much interested in meeting a mistress&mdash;let's face it&mdash;and
eventually it led to a breakup between us, between my ex-girl friend and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you came to this country in 1938?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. May of 1938.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May of 1938, I think it was. What did you do to sustain
yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I brought some money with me. I brought some
money with me&mdash;something like $10,000, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what did you immediately do in connection with that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. What did I do immediately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I mean did you enter <span class="locked">into&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I started looking for a job, very unsuccessfully, if I
may say so. In New York in those days, in 1938. I even started selling perfumes,
I remember, for a company called Chevalier Garde.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any interest in that company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; just purely as a salesman. I even sold some
materials for Shumaker and Company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where were you residing then, with your brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; part of the time. Then I had my own room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your brother was then living on Park Avenue, was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 750?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you&mdash;how long did you stay with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think as soon as I arrived we went to spend the
summer on Long Island, Belport, Long Island.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And at Belport, you made what acquaintances?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Lots of people, but especially Mrs. Bouvier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who is Mrs. Bouvier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Mrs. Bouvier is Jacqueline Kennedy's mother, also
her father and her whole family. She was in the process of getting a divorce
from her husband. I met him, also. We were very close friends. We saw each
other every day. I met Jackie then, when she was a little girl. Her sister, who
was still in the cradle practically. We were also very close friends of Jack
Bouvier's sister, and his father.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, bring yourself along.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That friendship more or less remained, because we
still see each other, occasionally&mdash;Mrs. Auchincloss, and occasionally correspond.</p>

<p>Well, then, I realized there was no future selling perfume or materials in the
State, and having had that background of the oil industry in my blood, because
my father was the director of Nobel Enterprises, which is a large oil concern
in Russia, which was eventually expropriated and confiscated, and I decided to
come and try to work for an oil company. I arrived in Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, sir. Before we get there&mdash;because that skips some
things&mdash;one of your efforts was as an insurance salesman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">And&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. How did you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were unsuccessful in that, were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Very unsuccessful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As a matter of fact, you didn't sell a single policy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Not a single policy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Over what period of a time did you pursue that activity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I even didn't pass my broker's examination. I tried
to get an insurance broker's license. I studied to be an insurance broker in the
State of New York. And I failed dismally that examination. So that was
the end of my insurance business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, we have you up to the advent of World War II, which
was&mdash;this is about 1941.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. But before that I was in Texas and worked for
Humble Oil Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Before 1941 you had gone to Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; in 1939.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You went to Texas in 1939?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And how did that come about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I was interested in the oil industry and
wanted to see in which way I could fit into the oil industry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whom did you contact? How did you get there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I went by bus&mdash;to Texas by bus. But what
actually helped me was that my sister-in-law, my wife's sister, had a very, very
close friend in Louisiana, Mrs. Margaret Clark&mdash;Margaret Clark Williams, who
had large oil properties, large estates in Louisiana. That is about the year
1939.</p>

<p>I got to Louisiana, as the guest, I remember&mdash;with my sister-in-law's aunt,
Mrs. Edwards. And then I looked the situation around in New Orleans and
decided to apply for a job with Humble Oil Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No. They had a branch office in New Orleans, but
I had to apply for a job in Houston. So I went to Houston, and I applied for a
job with Mr. Suman, who is vice president of Humble Oil Co. Also I met
the chairman of the board of the Humble Oil Co. through mutual acquaintances.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you return to Louisiana and do some work there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I worked in Terebonne Parish, on a rig.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You worked on a rig. This is physical work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Physical work, yes; lifting pipes, cleaning machinery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In other words, starting from the ground floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If there is such a thing in the oil business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Absolutely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whatever the bottom was, you were doing it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, sir. Very well paid, by the way&mdash;a very well
paid job, but very tough&mdash;at the time, you see, what good pay was at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think we might at this time see if I can describe you for the
record.</p>

<p>You are 6'1", are you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And now you weigh, I would say, about 195?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Back in those days you weighed around 180.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are athletically inclined?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have dark hair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No gray hairs yet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have a tanned&mdash;you are quite tanned, are you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you are an outdoorsman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. I have to tell you&mdash;I never expected you to
ask me such questions. I also tried to get various jobs otherwise. I went to
Arizona.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. De Mohrenschildt, one of the things I am trying to do is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
get your personality into the record, because many people have described your
personality.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Very different, probably.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I wouldn't say very different. But you would be surprised the
kind of things that are said about you. I don't know that you would be surprised.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I know that I have friends, I have enemies.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, everybody has.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I also went to Arizona, I remember, and tried to get
a job as&mdash;I don't know if it is after this experience with Humble Oil Co.&mdash;probably&mdash;over&mdash;to
get a job as a polo instructor at the Arizona Desert School.
Since we played polo in the military academy, I know how to play polo. I
am not an expert player, but I do know how to play polo, and I am a good
rider, and was a good rider. So I tried to get the job in the Arizona Desert
School for Boys. And for some reason I could not get this job. There was a
job available. I don't remember what the circumstances were. I never got this
job. But I think it is after my experience with Humble Oil Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You worked in the Louisiana oil fields as&mdash;what did you call it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. A roughneck, or roustabout, it is called.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you pursued that how long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think 3 or 4 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We are still in 1939?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Probably in 1939. And I got amoebic dysentery in
Louisiana, and got very sick. I had an accident on the rig, was badly cut up&mdash;something
fell on my arm, and then I got dysentery. And, frankly, I do not
recall whether they fired me or I resigned myself. I do not remember. Maybe
both&mdash;resigned and mutual agreement. But I remained very good friends with
the chairman of the board of the company, Mr. Blaffer. And he gave me the
idea already then to go in the oil business on my own. He says, "George, a
man of your background and education, you should be working for yourself,"
and he explained to me the fundamentals of the oil promotion, if you know
what I mean&mdash;drill wells, get a lease&mdash;drill a well, find some money to drill
that well.</p>

<p>Well, I said, "Mr. Blaffer, frankly it is a little above me to go in so early in
my experience in the United States&mdash;to go into that type of business. I don't
think I am capable enough to do that."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, you didn't have the capital at that time, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I didn't have the capital. But he said you could do it
without capital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. When you left the Louisiana oil fields, what did you
do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Went back to New York, recovered from my amoebic
dysentery. And I don't remember whether it is then that I tried insurance or
not. It is possible then that I was trying to work at this insurance broker's
deal. And then this friend of my sister-in-law's, Margaret Clark Williams, died,
and left all of us a certain amount of money. My sister-in-law, Mrs. Edwards,
myself&mdash;I don't remember what it was, $10,000 I guess, each. And what happened
then&mdash;yes, then comes the draft time in the U.S. Army.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is right; 1941.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you are in New York City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I am in New York City. I am called to the draft, and
they found I have high blood pressure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With the advent of the war in Europe, did <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, I forgot to tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you volunteer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. I was mobilized by the Polish Army in 1939&mdash;since
being a candidate officer, I was mobilized by the Polish Army, got the
papers in 1939 that I have to return to New York, and I did return to New York
in 1939. That was just exactly after my Texas experience with the Humble
Oil Co.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your Louisiana experience?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Louisiana, Texas, the same company. And it was
just&mdash;I was intending to return to Poland, because my father was there&mdash;I
had very close connection with my father. Somehow I felt maybe it was my
duty to be in the Polish Army.</p>

<p>And it was too late. The last boat, Battory, which took the people&mdash;I never
arrived in Poland.</p>

<p>I reported to the Polish Embassy here in Washington. It was too late to
join the Polish Army. Maybe all for the best, because I probably wouldn't be
alive today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have <span class="locked">some&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. You have to refresh my memory, because, as I say,
I never expected questions like this. Sometimes if I make a mistake, it is not
my intention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I don't suggest you are ever making a mistake. You are
calling on your own recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, yes; I am doing my best recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At this particular time, did you have some, oh, let me call it,
tenuous connection with some movie business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Facts, Inc.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right. That is another venture I went into.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was 1941?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I have a distant cousin by the name of Baron Maydell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, he was a controversial man, was he not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. A very controversial person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In what sense?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In the sense that some people considered him pro-Nazi.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was accused of being, was he not, during this period, a German
spy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No. I don't know that. But he had been an officer
in the Czarist Army. He was a White Russian. And having lost everything
through Communism, he saw the future of his return to Russia, back to his
estates, through German intervention. Like many other White Russians. He
possibly was more German than Russian&mdash;although he had been a Russian
citizen, officer of the Czarist Army, and so forth and so on. A controversial
person, no question about it. But I liked him. And he offered me to learn
something about the making of documentary movies.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Documentary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes&mdash;which is Facts&mdash;what was it called? Film
Facts Incorporated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Film Facts I think is the name of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. And he had a very interesting movie there of the
Spanish revolution which he made. And this movie was shown all over the
United States and was backed by&mdash;this, again, is my recollection, because it
almost escaped from my mind. This movie was backed by quite a number of
people here. I remember most of them&mdash;by Grace, who is president of Grace
Lines today. So we decided with Maydell that we could make another documentary
movie on the resistance of Poland. This is already&mdash;Poland had already
been occupied. The movies were made in Poland, I think, by Americans.
I don't recall that exactly&mdash;by Americans who were there during the occupation
of Warsaw. And Maydell had these movies in his possession, and we decided
to make a movie for the benefit of the Polish refugees.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Resistance movement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. And collected money to that effect, small
amounts of money from the sympathizers of Poland. To me it was actually a
very pleasant experience. I tried to do my best, number one, to make some
money; number two, to help the Polish cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
So I went to the Polish Consulate, made arrangements for the consul to be a
sponsor of this movie. And we eventually made this movie, put it together. It
was about 45 minutes long&mdash;a very interesting movie, very moving picture of
the resistance. But financially it was not a success. I don't even recall why.
Either Maydell never gave me any money or something. Anyway, we broke up
our partnership.</p>

<p>The movie did make some money for the Polish resistance fund. I think they
used it showing around the country. The Polish organizations in the United
States used that movie to show and collect money for their own purpose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I remember the picture was called "Poland Will
Never Die." It was an assembly job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, your interest was a business interest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; we also cut it together. We put the music together.
I learned a little bit about the technical end of it. We did not own the
studio, but we used the studio on the west side in New York to have the technical
facilities. Not very complicated. But we did it all together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was your grandfather born in this country?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; great grandfather, or great, great grandfather.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Sergius Von Mohrenschildt, born somewhere in Pennsylvania,
later went to Russia, entered the oil business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I will be darned. I didn't know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am not saying it is so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't remember. We have in the family some
Baltic Swede, an ancestor of ours, who was an officer of the Independence Army.
But his name was not Mohrenschildt. He was Baron Hilienfelt. My brother
knows of that, because he is more interested in it. He became an officer in the
Army of Independence, took the name of Ross. He was an officer in the Army
of Independence, and then went back to Europe and died there. And somebody
was telling me there was on his tomb in Sweden, I went later on to Sweden, and
I was curious and inquired about it. It was said he was a lieutenant or captain
in the American Army of Independence. So my brother, I think, because of that,
being an older member of the family, had the right to be&mdash;what do you call it&mdash;a
<span class="locked">descendant&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of the American Revolution?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right. He told me either he became a member
of it, or could become a member of it. I have to ask him about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Did you once describe your work in the insurance business as the lousiest,
stinkingest, sorriest type of business possible?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that wine company&mdash;was that the Vintage Wine, Inc.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I also was doing some selling of wine in Vintage
Wine, Inc.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On a commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have mentioned the Shumaker Company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is the name Pierre Fraiss familiar to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; this is one of my best friends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is he still alive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What business was he in then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He was then chief of export of Schumaker and
Company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Mr. Fraiss have any connection with the French intelligence
in the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you become involved with him in that connection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, it was just probably in 1941, I presume, in 1941.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, we collected facts on people involved in pro-German
activity, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was anti-German activity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On behalf of the French intelligence in the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I was never an official member of it, you see, but
I worked with Pierre Fraiss, and it was my understanding that it was French
intelligence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did that work take you around the country?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I think we went to Texas together again and
tried to contact the oil companies in regard to purchases of oil for the French
interests.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were the Germans also seeking to obtain oil?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">And&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. We were trying to out-bid them. I think the United
States were not at war yet at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. And so the French intelligence devised a system
whereby they could prevent the Germans and Italians from buying oil by outbidding
them on the free market. We went to Texas. We had some contacts
there with oil companies. And also in California. There we met the Superior
Oil people of California and other people, too, whose names now I have forgotten.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was that work completed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I could not tell you exactly, but I think it is
about&mdash;it was not completed. We just somehow petered out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you compensated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No&mdash;just my expenses, traveling expenses, and daily
allowance. It was handled by Mr. Fraiss. But no salary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think this whole thing, when the United States got
into war there was no more activity on their part, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, there was no need to outbid the Germans, because they
could not buy oil here anyhow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right. So that is how it ended.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mentioned a Mrs. Williams. Was that Margaret Williams?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she made a bequest to you of $5,000, wasn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes&mdash;I think $5,000&mdash;I thought it was $10,000, frankly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember being interviewed in February 1945?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. By whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Some agents of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In 1945?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. They interviewed me a couple of times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, you have been interviewed more than once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, at that time you are reported to have said that Mrs. Williams
left you the sum of $5,000, and I suggest to you that your recollection was
better in 1945 than it is now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, at or about the time that you were doing work with Mr.
Fraiss, did you meet a lady by the name of Lilia Pardo Larin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was in this country, was she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Oh, boy. Do you want to have everything about me?
Okay. I met her through a Brazilian friend of mine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. The King of Bananas of Brazil&mdash;his name will come
back to me. Dr.&mdash;I forgot his name. Anyway, a rich Brazilian, medical doctor,
very wealthy man, who traveled between Brazil and New York. Just recently
I was talking about him with the Brazilian Ambassador in Haiti, and
he says he is still alive and doing very well.</p>

<p>Dr. Palo Machado, Decio de Paulo Machado. An enormously wealthy Brazilian,
who calls himself the banana king, who liked American girls, the good
life, and very good businessman at the same time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You liked American girls, too, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I am not queer, you know. Although some people
accuse me of that even&mdash;even of that. Not as much as some other people, you
know&mdash;because this girl really was the love of my life&mdash;Lilia Larin. Anyway,
both Machado and I fell in love with this girl. She was a divorcee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She wasn't divorced as yet, was she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She was divorced already once. But she had a husband
some place in the background, who was a Frenchman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Guasco?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. With whom I got into a fistfight. Well, anyway,
the best man won, as it goes in the book, and Lilia and I fell in love&mdash;I
just got a discharge from the military service in the United States, 4-F, and she
invited me to come with her to Mexico. This was my experience with the FBI.
Really, it is so ridiculous that it is beyond comprehension.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, on your way to <span class="locked">Mexico&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Around Corpus Christi&mdash;really, if we didn't have
a sad story to discuss, the death of the President, you could laugh about some
of the activity of the FBI, and the money they spend following false trails.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, they don't know they are false when they are following
them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right. I don't know whose advice they
followed.</p>

<p>But, anyway, here we were about ready to enter Mexico and stopped for
awhile in Corpus Christi. And there we decided to go to the beach, from
Corpus Christi. I think my visa was not ready yet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You stayed at the Nueces Hotel in Corpus Christi?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; and we went to the beach.</p>

<p>On the way back from the beach, all of a sudden our car was stopped by some
characters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. You went to Aransas Pass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And when you were in Aransas Pass, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. We swam; and probably stayed on the beach enjoying
the sunshine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. What do they say we did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you make&mdash;take some photographs when you were in Aransas
Pass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Possibly; of each other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You took no photographs of a Coast Guard station at Aransas
Pass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't recall that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you make any sketches?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes&mdash;because I like to sketch. By the way, I forgot
to tell you, I like to sketch. I sketched the dunes, the coastline, but not the
Coast Guard station. Who gives a damn about the Coast Guard station in
Aransas Pass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I can tell you that is what got you into trouble.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Is that so? Well, you know, you are the first one to
tell me about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I want to know this. This interest that you say you have,
which I will bring out later, in sketching, in painting, water colors, and otherwise&mdash;you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
and this lady with whom you were in love were down at Aransas
Pass, you went down there for the purpose of having an outing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. I even have those sketches today, of the Bay
of Corpus Christi, of the seashore near Aransas Pass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You apparently were not aware of the fact this country was then
at war.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. But nobody told me there was any military installations
around Aransas Pass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, you were seen sketching the countryside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that aroused suspicion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right. That is the whole thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you were driving cross-country, were you not, with this
lady friend of yours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And on the way back then from Aransas <span class="locked">Pass&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Some characters stopped the car and came out of
the bushes, and they said, "You are a German spy." They said, "You are a
German citizen, you are a German spy." It was very strange. Here is my
Polish passport. So&mdash;they never said anything about sketching. I thought
they were from some comedy actors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Didn't they identify themselves?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think they said they were from the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They might have been from some other government service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Maybe some other government service. But I have
the impression they told me they were from the FBI, and they followed me
all the way from New York&mdash;all the way from New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In any event, five men stopped you at that time, searched your
car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Searched the car, found absolutely nothing, except
the water colors, the sketches. I still have the sketches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With that experience, did you proceed on into Mexico?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">And&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. They were very insulting to this Mexican lady, very
insulting. And I think she made a complaint about them later on to the
Mexican Ambassador. And being a vicious Mexican girl, she doesn't forget
that. I think she told them they stole something from her. That I do not
recall exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As near as I can tell, she never made any such complaint
officially.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think she told me she will complain officially.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She complained, but she never complained anything was stolen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You reached Mexico City?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And&mdash;with this lady.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you remained in Mexico how long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, that is 5 months, 6 months&mdash;until they expelled
me from Mexico.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does this refresh your recollection&mdash;that you made a statement
in 1945 when you were questioned that you remained in Mexico City for approximately
9 months, not doing much of anything except painting and going
around with Lilia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right. I did something. I invested some
money in a sugar factory there. I visited a sugar company there, and the
manager of the sugar company told me to invest some money in that outfit,
because it was going to&mdash;the stock was going to go up, which I did. I made
some nice money out of that investment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had funds when you went into Mexico, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had some letters of credit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would that amount to around $6,000?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Probably.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you travel to various places in Mexico during this 9 months
with this lady?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I had an apartment on my own in Mexico City,
on Avenue De&mdash;the main street of Mexico City. I don't recall the name. Paseo
de la reforma.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Towards the end of that 9 months you ran into some difficulty in
Mexico, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Boy, did I get in difficulty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there a man by the name of Maxino Comacho?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. General in the Mexican Army.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And as a result of&mdash;just give me that in capsule form.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think he wanted to take my girl friend away from
me. We were going to get married.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were serious about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Very serious. She was getting a divorce. I think
by the time she got to Mexico&mdash;she already got a Mexican divorce. I am sure
she did. She was already free.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She had a Mexican divorce, but there was some question about
whether it was good in the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right; something like that. Anyway, she
was getting a divorce. She was an exceedingly beautiful person. We thought
about getting married. And then this character intervened and had me thrown
out of the country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am not interested in his accusation, but he made some
accusation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He did, really?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am asking you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; no accusation. He said, "You are persona non
grata in Mexico." I actually went to the American Embassy, as far as I remember,
and said, "I am a resident of the United States, and why am I being thrown
out of the country?" I don't know if they have done anything about it. Anyway,
they suggested for me to leave, and go back to the States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You didn't leave immediately, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I went into hiding for a few days, because some
Mexican friends tried to have it all fixed. I remember the names of those
Mexicans who tried to help me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Manuel Garza; was he one of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your attorney?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; and Cuellar, another attorney. He is still a
good friend of mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You then returned to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. They said, "That is the best way for you, to leave,
because you cannot fight against the constitutional forces of Mexico."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. While in Mexico, you engaged in no espionage for anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were in love with this lady?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you saw her frequently, and her friends and other friends,
and did some traveling around Mexico?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where did you get the money to do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, $6,000, you know. And then we shared alike.
And I told you that life in Mexico was very cheap at the time. You could live
on a hundred dollars a month. One of my best friends there at the time was a
young MacArthur boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. General MacArthur's son?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Nephew, the son of MacArthur, the playwright. He
was also living in Mexico, very close friends. We made some trips together.
The son of John MacArthur.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You eventually returned to America, to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You went back to New York?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By train?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As a matter of fact, you went by chair car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That I didn't remember. How did you know that?
I don't remember, frankly. Those FBI people are excellent in following a chair
car. But, believe me, they are very <span class="locked">often&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it about this time when you returned that you started to
work on your book, "A Son of the Revolution"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, we are in what year&mdash;about 1942, 1943?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1942, I think.</p>

<p>Now, upon your return to New York, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I was working on that book. I sold that interest in
the sugar company&mdash;that is, the Mexican outfit I told you about&mdash;and then I
remember once I went to Palm Beach.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. What else did I do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you reached Palm Beach you met the lady who became
your first wife, Dorothy Pierson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me who was Dorothy Pierson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Dorothy Pierson was an attractive girl, the daughter
of a local real estate man whose mother was married to an Italian, Cantagalli,
Lorenzo Cantagalli, from Florence. And the mother and daughter came back
to the United States during the war. She was the daughter of Countess
Cantagalli by the first husband, who was an American. That is why her name
was Pierson. And, anyway, Dorothy and I fell in love with each other and got
married.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was quite young, was she not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Very young.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About 17 or 18?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you subsequently married where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In New York City?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. New York City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that marriage subsequently ended in divorce, did it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. About a year later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were married just a short time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Just a short time. A child was born.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There was a child born of that marriage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that child's name was Alexandra?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is she still alive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will deal with her subsequently, if I might. The divorce took
place&mdash;well, we might as well close up with Lilia. You never married her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you got back to the United <span class="locked">States&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. We pursued correspondence, and I intended to marry
her, and go back to Mexico. But there is no way of getting back to Mexico.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The records indicate that you made some effort here in Washington
to obtain reentry into Mexico, and you were unable to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that Lilia attempted to assist you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she attempted to come into this country?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She also was persona non grata at the moment, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She had two sons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. One of them was in Racine, Wis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Both of them were in military academy&mdash;young
boys.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And in any event, that eventually petered out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you met Dorothy Pierson in Palm Beach, Fla.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you subsequently married her in New York City, on the
16th of June 1943?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is the date. The dates of my marriage are
very vague now in my mind. I am taking your word for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I don't want you to take my word for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It is probably correct. You must have it some
place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall your daughter's birthday&mdash;it was on Christmas
Day, was it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1943?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During the period you were married to Dorothy in New York
City, what did you do, if anything, other than work on your proposed book?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I had an exhibition of my paintings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I want to get into that. While you were in Mexico, did you
do some painting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I did a lot of painting&mdash;a whole tremendous file of
paintings in Mexico.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you subsequently exhibit those paintings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Newton Gallery, New York, 57th Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did those paintings receive comment from the critics?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. The newspapers wrote about them, that they were
original, but the sales were hardly successful, if I may say so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you still have some of those paintings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; some I have given away, but I still have some.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They are water colors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Water colors, washes; yes. But no military
installation&mdash;the tropical jungle. Girls, tropical jungle, Mexican types&mdash;I am
very fond of Mexico. Roderick MacArthur and I tried to make a trip at the
time through the wilderness of Mexico together in an old Ford which belonged
to him; the road did not exist yet, so we went together in this old broken
down Ford, drove, drove and drove a couple of days with no roads, and finally
one <span class="locked">evening&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is in Mexico?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; during that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During the 9 months you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; we hit a steel pole sticking out in the middle
of the trail, and the whole car disintegrated under us. So we walked back a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
couple of days in order to get back to Mexico City. We left the car right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. If you see him in Chicago&mdash;I will write to him again;
and I hope to see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You came to Texas in 1944, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. 1944.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall making a loan at <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Russian Student Fund?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. After my divorce I decided that I am still
interested in this oil business, and all my pursuits in various directions are not
too successful, so I should go back to school and study geology and petroleum
engineering.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you made inquiry at the Colorado School of Mines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. Tried Colorado School of Mines, Rice Institute,
and University of Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. You are now about 33 years old, somewhere in that
neighborhood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During these years you led sort of a bohemian life, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. Well, you see&mdash;bohemian and trying to make
a buck, as you might call it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am trying to bring out your personality.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right. But you see the main reason I actually
came to the United States is to look for a country which did not have&mdash;which
was a melting pot, because I am a melting pot myself, as you can see.
I changed from one country to another, a complete mixture. So I thought
that would fit me right. And eventually it did. It took a long time to get
adjusted to it. The first five years are very difficult in the United States. I
didn't speak English very well. And it was just tough going. Fortunately I
had friends, acquaintances, and a lot of relations. But, otherwise, I probably
would have starved. And it did actually happen that I did starve occasionally.
So I decided to <span class="locked">go&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were young and full of energy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. While working for the Humble Oil Co. I said that
a man without the education in that particular field&mdash;I did not have the background
of geology or petroleum engineering, except that I kept on studying by
myself. I didn't have much chance to succeed. I was wrong, by the way. I
should have followed Mr. Blaffer's advice and gone in the oil business, and I
would have been a multimillionaire today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, you might still be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I probably will be. But really that was&mdash;he
was the man, the only man who gave me the right advice&mdash;of all my friends and
acquaintances. He said, "George, go on your own and try to speculate on oil
leases and drill wells on your own," which is the basis of the oil industry. "We
will give you a lease, you can promote some money to drill on it, and here you
have it." And that is what happened. That is the origin of many, many of my
friends in Texas who are very wealthy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. You came to <span class="locked">Texas&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Came to <span class="locked">Texas&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1944.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was following your divorce from Dorothy Pierson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. Got a loan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You <span class="locked">entered&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Entered the University of Texas, and School of
Geology, and Petroleum Engineering as my minor&mdash;major in petroleum geology
and minor in petroleum engineering. And with a fantastic effort and speed I
succeeded in getting my master's degree in petroleum geology and minor in
petroleum engineering in 1945, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You received your master's in 1945, did you not?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And in petroleum geology?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; with minor in petroleum engineering.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you pursue your studies further?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; well, I wrote a dissertation. I pursue my
studies as the time goes by. But that was the end of my education in American
schools.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, while you were at the University of Texas, did you serve
as an <span class="locked">instructor&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In French.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had no tenure there? You were not a professor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; an instructor in French, to make some additional
money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you complete your work at the University of Texas&mdash;all
of your studies?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In the fall of 1945.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long were you at the University of Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think about 2 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, following your obtaining your master's degree at the University
of Texas, did you enter into business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I got a job waiting for me in Venezuela, the
Pantepec Oil Co. in Venezuela.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the nature of that work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I worked as a field engineer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In Venezuela?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. Very good salary; pleasant conditions. But
eventually fought with the vice president.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Eventually I got into some personal trouble with the
vice president, and this time was not kicked out but through mutual agreement
it was decided between Warren Smith, who was my president, and a close friend,
that I should resign and <span class="locked">also&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you leave that position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Some time in 1946.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I interrupted you. You were going to add something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Some time in 1946. And also I wanted to come
back to the States to renew my citizenship paper application, because I would
lose my citizenship papers by staying in Venezuela too long, you see.</p>

<p>It was an American company all right, but I think it was incorporated in
Venezuela.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have to have a passport to get to that position in
Venezuela?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; well, I think I still have my Polish passport.
But I had a reentry permit to the States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So you returned to the United States in 1946?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I arrived back through New York, but stayed
a very short time, and went to Texas again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What town?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. To Houston. To look for a job. I did not want
to be in a tropical part of the United States, in a hot part. I was trying to
find a job somewhere in the northern part of the United States. And then I
heard that there is a job available as an assistant to the chairman of the
Rangely Field Engineering Committee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At Rangely, Colo.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what was the field engineer's name? He is now dead, is
he not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; Joe Zorichak.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There was an assistant. What was his name? There were two
of you assisting the chairman?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't remember the other assistant's name. I
was the only one in the office. Later on&mdash;we were part of the group of all the
oil companies operating there. But we were the only ones actually working
for the committee. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will find it here in a moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. You see, this committee was a consulting organization
set up by, I think, 8 or 10 oil companies operating in Rangely Field, which
is the largest field in Colorado, in the Rocky Mountains. It still is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does the name James Gibson sound familiar to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; Gibson&mdash;James Gibson; yes. But he was not
in our outfit. He was an engineer for Standard Oil of California. But he
worked very close to us. In other words, he was an employee of the Standard
Oil of California.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does the name J. M. Bunce sound familiar to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He was a representative of a pumping outfit from
California who sold oil well pumps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, this Rangely Engineering Committee was formed by the
various oil companies?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And they were operating in the Rangely, Colo., oil field, is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And for the purpose of compiling statistics and engineering
data for the entire field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No, yes; this and also to allocate production to
various wells in the field, because we didn't have any regulatory body in
Colorado at the time. We actually applied a certain formula to each well to
see how much each well would be allowed to produce. This was our main job,
you know.</p>

<p>Then, of course, our job was to coordinate the technical advances in that
field and promote the new methods of drilling producing, to cut down expenses
in the field. Among other things, we introduced diamond drilling there, drilling
with diamond bits, which eventually became very, very successful.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, this was what&mdash;1947?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. 1946, 1947. I stayed there, I think, about 3½ years,
something like that. 3 years, maybe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, at this time you met and married your second wife, did
you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Phyllis Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, tell us about that a little bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I went on a vacation to New York, met a very
pretty girl, and she was willing to follow me in the wilderness of Colorado,
which she did. She was young and a little bit wild. But very, very attractive
and adventurous. And she came with me to Colorado&mdash;without being married.</p>

<p>Her father was with the State Department, Walter Washington.</p>

<p>But I didn't know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was an adopted child?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Her name originally was Wasserman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; something like that. And she was a beautiful
girl who decided to come to Colorado with me. She stayed with me, we fell in
love. She created a terrible confusion in Colorado. Imagine an international
beauty with bikinis. I don't know if it is for the record. With bikinis, walking
around the oil fields. But she was a wonderful girl, wonderful girl. She
gave up the possibility of going to Spain, where her father was appointed
charge d' affaires at the time. She decided she would rather stay with me
in Colorado in the wilderness.</p>

<p>And I will tell you, that was a terrible place. That was the last boomtown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
in America. Rangely, the last boomtown in the United States. We lived in
shacks, we lived in 40-degree below zero temperature, mud. It is the roughest
place you ever saw in your life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You eventually tired of Rangely, Colo., and moved over to
Aspen, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I didn't move to Aspen. I just had a little
cabin in Aspen. I had a cabin in Aspen, and would go there on weekends.
But then I became chairman.</p>

<p>Joe Zorichak resigned his position and moved to Dallas as assistant president
of the American Petroleum Institute, assistant to the president of the API.
And I was appointed to replace him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it about this time that you took residence in Aspen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, no; about that time. I would say&mdash;I didn't
take residence. I just had a cabin in Aspen.</p>

<p>But I commuted between Rangely and Aspen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is quite a commutation. It is 165 miles, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Nothing for the oil field.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But it takes a long time to get 165 miles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. 3 hours. But naturally I would go there on the
weekend and come back. Probably they accuse me of spending all my time in
Aspen. But, anyway, what finally happened is, good or bad, we decided to
sever connections with the Rangely Engineering Committee. They decided to
stop completely the Rangely Engineering Committee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had some difficulties with them before they decided to
break it up, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't remember too much of a difficulty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there something about your spending too much time over
at Aspen, and not <span class="locked">being&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, they never told me that. But possibly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The severance of your relationship was mutual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, I think so. I don't think&mdash;you may call it I
was fired, but I don't think so. As far as I remember, we just got together with
the manager of Texaco in Denver and he told me, "George, we are just going to
stop the operation at Rangely Field of the Engineering Committee."</p>

<p>I was the only one left, you see. So I said fine, stop it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this was about when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I forgot to tell you. Since you are interested
in my character&mdash;is that it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. At Rangely. Colo., it stopped being an operating oil
field, and it became a statistical job. When I moved there first it was the
greatest boomtown and the greatest drilling place in the United States. We had
30 rigs going. It was very interesting.</p>

<p>Every day we had new problems. It was a very active life. Then at the
end of my stay there was no work practically except to compile the statistical
report. So naturally I started going to Aspen more often. I don't think I ever
had any complaint against me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were interested a great deal initially when the field was
being developed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When it degenerated, if I may use that term, into a statistical
assembly, you lose interest, spent more time over at Aspen, and there were some
disagreements about that, a difference of opinion, and your employers questioned
it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any problem about your savoir-faire, for example,
attitude with respect to keeping expenses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Maybe so. But you know, our salary was very small
there, and so we had to show certain expenses. They never questioned me. But
possibly they considered my living expenses were too high. But I was the only
one to do the job, instead of two. I kept the budget, more or less, at the same
level, maybe lower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you terminated your employment in January 1949, did
you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think so. The date is not clear to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, this may refresh your recollection.</p>

<p>Had you become an American citizen in the meantime?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was that on the 11th of July 1949 at Denver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, in Denver, Colo.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, your employment with the Rangely Oil Field Committee
terminated after you became a citizen, did it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And does that refresh your recollection&mdash;it occurred about 6
months later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When your employment in the Rangely Oil Field Committee
terminated, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Then I realized that I could not remain married to
Phyllis, because she was a girl of&mdash;who needed money, who needed a good way
of life, needed luxury&mdash;she was used to luxury. And I asked her to go back
to her parents, to New York, and that I will try to make a success out of&mdash;I
decided to go on my own as a consultant&mdash;that I should try to make a success
out of the consulting business.</p>

<p>But I just should do it by myself, without her being present. And so I moved
to Denver, Colo., gave up that establishment in Aspen, and got some help from
my friends, and with very little money I started my own consulting firm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In Denver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; in Denver.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the meantime, did the&mdash;was the marriage to Phyllis Washington
terminated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; either in the meantime or just right at that
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that by her suit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; by my suit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You filed the suit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And where did you file that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In the court in Denver. She was gone. I returned
in the meantime to see her, to see whether we can patch up things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You returned to New York City?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; to see if we could patch up things. We became
very good friends with the other side of her family, the Wassermans, very
interesting people who are still good friends of mine. Bill Wasserman is a
banker in New York, used to be ambassador to Australia during the Roosevelt
administration, I think&mdash;or to New Zealand.</p>

<p>And, frankly, he also, and her aunt, who were taking care of her&mdash;because,
in the meantime, her stepfather was in Europe, they had also their own
difficulties.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Their own marital difficulties?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; they decided we better forget about this marriage.
We remained very fond of each other. But we finally came to an agreement
to have a divorce. And I filed a suit for divorce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was that decree entered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, that I do not remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you get your divorce decree from Phyllis Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In a court in Denver, Colo., but I do not recall the
date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1949 or 1950?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Something around that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were any children born of that marriage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No children. We were married in Grand Junction,
Colo. And the divorce was entered&mdash;the reason was desertion, which was actually
true, because she did not come back to me. She stayed in New York, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
eventually&mdash;she drank, also, an awful lot. Today she is an alcoholic&mdash;poor girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You entered the oil consulting business in Denver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. First of all, as just an ordinary consultant.
I got helped by a friend of mine who has a small oil company in Denver.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Jimmy Donahue. And he facilitated by giving his
office, the secretary and so on. Because it is rather expensive to start on your
own.</p>

<p>But very soon afterwards I started getting consulting jobs&mdash;doing evaluations
on the wells and things like that. And one night&mdash;this will be interesting for you,
how to start an oil business&mdash;one night I was driving through Oklahoma, tired as
hell, and I said to myself, by God, everybody is making money in the oil business
except me, I am just a flunky here for all these big operators&mdash;I should go in
the oil business on my own, really in the oil business, drilling and producing,
which was interesting to me. And then I recalled that my ex-nephew, Eddie
Hooker, in New York, asked me to go in business with him. He had visited me
in Colorado and was very much interested in the work I had done. I gave him
a telephone call from some place in Oklahoma.</p>

<p>I said, "Eddie, how about it?"</p>

<p>He was working for Merrill Lynch at the time.</p>

<p>And he said, "George, I am ready. I am tired of Merrill Lynch."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Merrill Lynch, Fenner and Beane at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. "I am tired of that Merrill Lynch, Fenner and
Beane."</p>

<p>We formed a limited partnership together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is the partnership of Hooker and De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that was when&mdash;1950?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I think so&mdash;1950.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did it last very long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It lasted, I think, 3 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About 2 years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. 2 or 3 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">And&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Now, we made money, we lost money, but it was a
pleasant relationship. We are still very good friends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you do in connection with that partnership?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I did buying of the leases, doing the drilling,
and helped him in New York, also, to raise money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He handled the financial end, or raising of money end?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you the field work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. Sometimes&mdash;we opened an office in New York,
a small office. He was in New York most of the time. I was in Denver.</p>

<p>Our first well was a dry hole, a disastrous dry hole. But our second well
was a producer. We made some production. But never anything big.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Eventually I returned to Texas from Denver, because
I had always retained some good friends in Texas, and they suggested,
one of them who participated in our well, first venture&mdash;suggested that, "George,
you will do better in Texas, because Wyoming is too expensive"&mdash;a well costs
$200,000 or $300,000 in Wyoming, you know&mdash;in Wyoming or Colorado.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, when you were in partnership with Mr. Hooker, your field
work and discovery work was in Wyoming and Colorado, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No. We started by drilling our first well in Wyoming,
operating from Denver. And we had&mdash;we were snowbound there, we paid the
rig time for a hell of a long time. To make the story short, our first venture
was quite a failure. One of the reasons we finally split partnership with Eddie
Hooker is that he is a very wealthy boy. He comes from a very wealthy family.
And he wanted the oil business to make millions.</p>

<p>My reason to be in the oil business is to make a reasonable living, and eventually
build up some production.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
On our first venture in Wyoming, on the very first one, after we bought the
leases, and before starting drilling, we got an offer from another company to sell
out for a very substantial profit, without drilling a well&mdash;they would do it.
Naturally, I told Ed we should do that instead of running a tremendous risk
of drilling our own well. Well, he said if they want to buy it it means that
we have something there, the usual story.</p>

<p>I was a little more conservative&mdash;I said better sell out and try to find something
less risky.</p>

<p>He said if we hit it, we are millionaires right away&mdash;which was true&mdash;we
had a huge block, of 12,000 acres, something like that.</p>

<p>Well, from then on, the next venture was in Texas, and we drilled quite
a few successful wells, quite a few dry holes, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You returned to Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Abilene, Tex., we had the headquarters&mdash;that was the
center of the small size independent operators at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the name of the hotel at which you stayed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Wooten Hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the partnership was still in existence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. Our partnership was broken up after I married
Miss Sharples. It was, frankly, a personal thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think this is a good time to stop, because that is the next phase
I want to get into. We can go to lunch.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 12:35 p.m., the proceeding was recessed.)</p>

<hr />
<h2>TESTIMONY OF GEORGE S. DE MOHRENSCHILDT RESUMED</h2>

<p>The proceeding reconvened at 2 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the record.</p>

<p>Before we start on the next phase of your life, I would like to go back a
minute to your father.</p>

<p>You left there about 1931 or 1932?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; but I came back many times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You came back to see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; almost every summer vacation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, what happened to your father, with particular reference
to World War II?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He was living in Wilno, the same town that I went
to school in, during the war, and I arranged for his visa to come to the United
States at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, is this at a time when you were in this country?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I was in this country, and I knew that&mdash;this
was before the outbreak of the war. I arranged for the visa to come to America,
and he did not take advantage of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That invasion was in September of 1939.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. 1939; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you made these arrangements before September 1939?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Before September 1939. And instead of that, you
know, he did not take advantage of those arrangements. Maybe he was too
old, decided not to come to the United States. And then there was the German
invasion of Poland and the Russian invasion on the other, and he happened
to be in the Russian part of Poland, and naturally went into hiding.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. You mean Russian part in the sense that the
Russians invaded Poland?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To meet the Germans who were invading Poland from the other
side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So he then became engulfed by the Russians?</p>

Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right. He became engulfed in advance of
the Russian Army and had to go into hiding because he had a sentence of life
exile to Siberia against him. And at that time the Germans and the Russians
were not at war yet, so the Russians and the Germans made an agreement that
all the people of German or Baltic or Swedish origin could go to Germany,
and they could declare themselves openly and go to a special German commission
set up for that effect in various towns.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You say declare themselves openly. What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Declare themselves that they they are willing to go and
live in Germany, instead of living in Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Declare allegiance to the German Government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right&mdash;declare allegiance to the German
Government, and declare themselves Volkdeutsche, which means of Germanic
origin. Russia had many millions of people of that type, an enormous German
colony. So the Germans did it in order to get all those Germans from the
Volga Province into their own country. And all the other people, like my father.
And he declared himself willing to go to Germany, and the Germans took him
into Germany. He would rather be with the Germans than with the Communists,
and spent the rest of his <span class="locked">life&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was your father still anti-Communist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; very strongly anti-Communist&mdash;&mdash;exceedingly
strongly anti-Communist, almost fanatically so. Naturally, he had the sentence
against him. And then he spent the rest of his life in Germany and was
killed at the end of the war in an air raid, as far as we know&mdash;some air raid
hit that place where he lived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know what town it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I don't know the town, but it is an old castle
in Oldenburg. It is near the Danish border. My brother is going to go right
now there to visit his tomb, because neither of us had the time to go and see
that place. But he is in Europe now, and he will go and see the place where
he was buried.</p>

<p>Eventually, we received some of his papers and documents and letters through
some German friends who stayed there with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I take it he was&mdash;we can at least fairly say that he had
sympathies, or was sympathetic with the German cause?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I remember we exchanged letters with him
during the war through some friends in Argentina and in Japan, before Japan
got into the war. My father wrote me a letter in which he said, "George, the
Nazis are no good, and Germany is going to lose the war, but I prefer to be in
Germany than in Soviet Russia. At least I am free and nobody is bothering me."</p>

<p>It was the policy of the Germans to protect the people who had some positions
in Czarist Russia. But he never became pro-Nazi. He was too clear thinking
for that. He liked the Germans all right, but he was not pro-Nazi. But he
hated Communism. That was his life's hatred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, we have you back in New York City&mdash;this is when we
went to lunch&mdash;around 1953&mdash;1952, 1953.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your partnership with Mr. Hooker had terminated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No, no; still active. I think it was in 1952&mdash;because
I was not married&mdash;we still had the partnership. I was visiting Ed
Hooker in New York at that particular time, and through him I met my next
wife, my last wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, who was she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Wynne Sharples.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She at that time was a student?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She was just graduating from the medical school at
the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University. That was her
last year. And she was late in her studies. She was 28 or 29 years old at that
time. So she had missed a couple of years, you see. And we fell in love with
each other and decided to get married.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me about the Sharples family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. The Sharples family is from Philadelphia, Philadelphia
Quakers. He is in the centrifugal processing business and also in the
oil business. And I had dealings with his nephew for many years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Butler, Samuel Butler, Jr. He runs the oil end of
Mr. Sharples' operations. And they had a small interest in Rangely Field.
That is how I got acquainted with Mr. Butler.</p>

<p>So we knew about each other before&mdash;my wife's father, and so on and so
forth&mdash;and&mdash;the daughter asked his advice, whether she should marry such
an adventurous character like me, and the father said, all right&mdash;obviously had
sufficient good information from Butler about me. Butler was my best man
at the wedding.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Best man at your wedding to Miss Sharples?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; Sam Butler.</p>

<p>There were several ushers. He was one of the ushers. I don't remember who
was the best man. My brother was the best man. He was one of ushers. So
we got married.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the Sharples family wealthy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Very wealthy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Socially prominent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Socially prominent. But not too interested in society,
because they are Quakers, you know. But my wife is <span class="locked">interested&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She has a nickname?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; Didi.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Some of the people apparently&mdash;voluntarily&mdash;they know her with
that nickname&mdash;Didi.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right. We got married, I think, after her
graduation immediately in the Unitarian Church in Chestnut Hills.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is that&mdash;a suburb of Philadelphia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. A suburb of Philadelphia. And she moved to
Dallas, and I moved to Dallas, also, from Abilene, where I used to live, so she
could continue her work in the medical field, and to take her residence in the
hospital in Dallas. She was a resident <span class="locked">physician&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In what hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In the Baylor Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Baylor University?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it university connected?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't remember. But it is Baylor Hospital, in
Dallas. It is not the same as Baylor University. It is called Baylor Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. And she stayed there as a resident. I worked very
often in my office in Dallas, instead of Abilene, and continued my partnership
with Ed Hooker. But there developed a tremendous animosity between Ed
Hooker's wife and my wife, Didi.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Ed Hooker's wife <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Was an ex-model, very attractive girl, Marion.
And probably my wife snubbed her or something. She didn't come from such a
prominent family.</p>

<p>Anyway, there was a great deal of animosity there. And Ed told me, "George,
you are a fool to marry this girl&mdash;she is nuts."</p>

<p>She had had nervous breakdowns.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is Mr. Hooker's wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; that is my ex-wife, Didi Sharples. She is
very high strung&mdash;she is a very high-strung person, and had nervous breakdowns
while going to medical school. I don't know if it is interesting for you,
all those details.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I think not as to that. I am interested, though&mdash;she came
to Dallas with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She came to Dallas to live with me. We had an
apartment first. Then we bought a house jointly, a farm, a small farm outside
of Dallas. And then she had&mdash;we had two children, Sergei, and a girl, Nadejeda,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
whom we called Nadya because the name is very difficult. It is my aunt's
name, and Sergei is my father's name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When were those children born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. One year difference&mdash;in 1953 and 1954.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your son was born in 1953 and your daughter in 1954?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think you were about to tell me some differences arose, you
thought, between Mr. Hooker's wife and your wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did that have an effect on your partnership?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; it was more or less, I would say, a social problem
and personal dislike. Ed is very much devoted to his wife. He told me
one day, "We cannot continue this partnership in such unpleasant circumstances,
and I think we should break our partnership and sell out what we
have." We had some oil properties and we sold it out and divided the proceeds.</p>

<p>Oh, yes&mdash;also, Ed was dissatisfied that I moved away from the oilfield&mdash;another
reason we broke our partnership. Because I was staying in the oilfields
before that all the time. But now I moved to Dallas, and I could not be right
in the center of the oil activity, according to him. It turned out to be that this
actually was much better for the oil business, to be in Dallas than to be in
Abilene.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, because we are more or less in the center of
things than just in a small hick town, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">You&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. At the same time about, when we were breaking
this partnership, my wife's uncle, Col. Edward J. Walz, from Philadelphia, who
is an investment man and a man who is fascinated by the oil business, offered
me to form a partnership with him, and we formed a partnership just about
the same time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you identified this new man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; Col. Edward J. Walz, this was my wife's uncle,
Miss Sharples' uncle&mdash;much younger than his&mdash;than her mother, but a man of
substance, from Philadelphia&mdash;with whom we developed friendly relationship.
He liked me and I liked him. And we decided to form a partnership, and we
called this partnership Waldem Oil Co.&mdash;with the idea of doing the same thing
I did with Ed Hooker&mdash;that I would do the fieldwork and he would do, more
or less, the financial end of the business in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>We had several very successful dealings together. On our first drilling venture
we found oil. I kept producing that little field for quite some time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Post field, in Texas&mdash;a small part of this field belonged
to us, and we kept on producing. We did other operations in the oil
business, selling leases, buying leases, and things like that.</p>

<p>But we didn't do anything spectacular because he never could provide any
large amounts of money for anything spectacular. We did small things. It
was a small operation. But we always made money together.</p>

<p>Eventually, after my wife and I got <span class="locked">divorced&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you mention divorce. You and Wynne Sharples were
divorced?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And when did that take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That, I think, was in 1957, I guess, or 1956. We
were married for 5 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, it must have been 1957, then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. 1957, yes; it turned out to be that both of our children
had cystic fibrosis&mdash;it is a terrible illness of genetic nature. The children
who have it have no hope to recover, as yet.</p>

<p>Now, my ex-wife and I started a foundation, National Foundation for Cystic
Fibrosis in Dallas, of which Jacqueline Kennedy was the honorary chairman.</p>

<p>Now, my ex-wife says that I didn't have much to do with this foundation, this
Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, but actually I did, because I collected most of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
money from my Dallas friends. It started with very little&mdash;we started with
$10,000 or $20,000, and now it is a $2 million foundation, with headquarters in
New York. Last year I was chairman of this foundation in Dallas for the first
public subscription to our Cystic Fibrosis Fund for the Dallas children, and
we got $25,000.</p>

<p>Now my son, Sergei, died from cystic fibrosis in 1960.</p>

<p>By the way, the reason for our divorce, in addition to whatever disagreements
we had, which was not very important, was the fact that we both obviously
have a tendency for cystic fibrosis, a genetic affinity for cystic fibrosis, and the
children born from such a marriage have a very poor chance to survive. She
wanted more children. She was scared to have more children with cystic
fibrosis. The little girl is still alive. She lives in Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She is with her mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. With her mother, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is her mother pursuing her profession in Philadelphia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Her mother is not actually practicing but she is in
charge of the Cystic Fibrosis Research Institute in Philadelphia, she is a trustee
of Temple University.</p>

<p>But her husband, Dr. <span class="locked">Denton&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She remarried?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She remarried.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is his full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Dr. Robert Denton. He is the doctor who treated
our children for cystic fibrosis. At present he is a professor of pediatrics and
assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I don't want to go into the litigation. There was some litigation,
was there not, between you and your former wife with respect to some trust?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Trust fund.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Established for whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Established for Sergei, for our son. Now, I had to
contribute, according to the divorce, $125 a month for the support of the children,
which I did, and she put that money in a trust fund. She did not want to use
that money for the upkeep of the children, because she is independently wealthy,
and eventually she refused to accept any more contribution of money from me.
I objected on my side to the fact that I was removed away&mdash;that the children
were very far away from me. They were living in Boston at the time, and I
encountered constantly difficulties in regard to my visitation rights of the
children. Well, anyway, finally all of a sudden, after Sergei died, a long time
afterwards, I received a notification that we inherited, my ex-wife and I&mdash;we
inherited this trust fund.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which trust fund?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Established for Sergei, our son.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who established the trust fund?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Her grandfather, my boy's grandfather, Mr. Sharples,
plus the money that came from my monthly contribution for the children's
support&mdash;whatever money she could put in it. Anyway, it was a small trust
fund of $24,000, which eventually was split up between my ex-wife and myself&mdash;about
$12,000 each. There was a litigation in regard to that, but I don't know
if it is interesting for you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No&mdash;I have the complaints. Your ex-wife&mdash;Dr. Denton lives in
Philadelphia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she does research work, does she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She doesn't do the actual research. She is more or
less running the administration end of a second foundation. She was eventually
asked to leave the National Cystic Fibrosis Foundation which we had formed
together in Dallas, and which became this national foundation.</p>

<p>She developed some difficulty with the other trustees and was asked to resign,
or resigned herself&mdash;I don't know for sure&mdash;the other trustees say they asked
her to resign. She says she was forced to resign. And she formed with the
help of her father and her friends another foundation in Philadelphia which is
much smaller, and I think which does also research on cystic fibrosis. And she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
is running the administrative end of it. She is not doing the actual research,
but she is running this foundation as an administrator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you visit your child?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I used to. Right now I have a great deal of difficulty
in visiting my daughter, Nadya, because she wants to live with me, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The daughter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. The daughter, yes. And she thinks that by living in
Texas her health will improve. Now, the mother thinks it is just the opposite&mdash;that
if she lives in Texas that she will die, because of the inadequate medical
facilities. So we had rather bitter litigation last year as to&mdash;I tried to take the
custody away from her, because of various reasons&mdash;mainly, I think that the
daughter would be happier with me, and with my new wife. And the little girl
has developed a tremendous liking for my new wife. But the court decided
that&mdash;we went into such bitter fighting, that I stopped this litigation in the
middle, and I said, "I am going to Haiti anyway. Let's leave things as they are
for a year. I am not going to see Nadya for a year, on the condition that she
will get all my letters, all my gifts, and that I get a medical report from her
every 4 months." And the poor girl is also under psychiatric treatment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Nadya, my little girl. She is under psychiatric treatment&mdash;because
of her illness, and also she developed a dislike for the other
members of her family, for her half brothers and sisters, because they are
healthy, and she is not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it that your former wife&mdash;there had been some children
born of her present marriage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; who have no cystic fibrosis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, when the divorce took place, your wife filed suit
in Philadelphia, didn't she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; the suit was filed in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She commenced it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you resist it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; we came to an agreement that we would get
a divorce anyway. I don't know what you call it in legal terms. The lawyers
made an agreement that, here it is, you see. We decided to sell our house and
settle our accounts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Property?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Property settlement. And I think it was very fair
for her, just as my lawyer, Morris Jaffe, can tell you the whole story about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, upon your divorce from Wynne, or Didi, Sharples, did you
remain in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I stayed in Dallas, carried on my consulting
work in the same manner, concentrating mostly from then on on the foreign end
of this business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What do you mean foreign end?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I started taking more and more foreign jobs. In
1956 I took a job in Haiti for a private&mdash;for some private individuals connected
with Sinclair Oil Company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In 1956&mdash;just before our divorce, I think. We were
already separated. Then we must have been divorced the end of 1956.</p>

<p>Sorry&mdash;too many marriages, too many divorces. So I started taking more
and more foreign jobs. And, also, in my relationship with Mr. Sharples,
because&mdash;my ex-wife's father&mdash;I did some foreign work for him, mainly in
Mexico. He had some foreign exploitation in Mexico, some oil operations in
Mexico. Anyway, I started getting a lot of foreign jobs&mdash;maybe jobs in Nigeria.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I want to know what countries you were taken to in connection
with those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, all in all, I visited and I did foreign work,
which means preparation for taking of concessions and suggestion of what areas
should be taken for an oil and gas concessions&mdash;it was in Nigeria, in Togoland,
in Ghana, in France&mdash;I may have forgotten with some other countries where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
I did not have to go, but I did some work right there in Dallas&mdash;examined
the geological work and made suggestions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. And <span class="locked">eventually&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did travel to Mexico?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; many, many times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In connection with that work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In Cuba, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, in Cuba&mdash;I traveled in Cuba before Castro,
during the Batista days. The ex-president of Pantitec Oil Co. formed the
Cuban-Venezuela Oil Co., a development&mdash;a land development to promote eventually
a large oil drilling campaign in Cuba. He almost owned about half of the
whole country under lease. This was during the Batista days. He invited me to
come there and look the situation over, and make recommendations. And so
I visited the fields there, and his office&mdash;that type of job that I had from time
to time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I want to get the countries now. <span class="locked">Cuba&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Cuba, Mexico, <span class="locked">Ghana&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. These are your travels now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. That is where I actually went.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is what I want to know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Ghana, Nigeria, Togoland, and France.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, all of this was in connection with the work you were doing
with respect to oil exploration and gas exploration and development for what
group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. For No. 1&mdash;for Charmex. Then Cuban Venezuelan
Trust&mdash;that is Warren Smith Co. Then the Three States Oil and Gas Co. in
Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now&mdash;were there some other companies?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; then Lehman Trading Corp. in New York.
I may have had other jobs, but they escape me now. But they were all consulting
jobs for clients of mine&mdash;either from Texas or from New York. And
then in 1957 those foreign jobs led to my being pretty well known in that field.
I was contacted by Core Lab in Dallas in regard to a job in Yugoslavia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us about that. That was <span class="locked">for&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That was for ICA&mdash;a job for ICA and for the
Yugoslav Government.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us what ICA is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. International Cooperation Administration here in
Washington&mdash;which wanted an oil and gas specialist to go to Yugoslavia and
help them develop oil resources under the&mdash;I don't know&mdash;some kind of government
deal. Under <span class="locked">this&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did a man named Charles Mitchell accompany you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes&mdash;George Mitchell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And his wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I found him because he was a geophysicist.
In other words, I did the geology and petroleum engineering, and he did pure
geophysics. The ICA needed two men. I looked over the country for somebody
who was capable and willing to go to Yugoslavia, and found George Mitchell
in Dallas, and eventually both of us went there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were single at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he was married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He was married.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And his wife accompanied him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She did; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was for the International Cooperation Administration?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Washington 25, D.C.</p>

<p>The Yugoslavian Government paid my living expenses there, and the ICA
paid my salary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you had a contract of some kind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I think the contract was for 8 or 9 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you left on that venture, as I recall it, somewhere around
February of 1957, wasn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I left for Yugoslavia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; you left for Yugoslavia when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think it was very early in 1957, because, 8 months,
and I returned in October.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1957?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. 1957; yes. All the reports were made&mdash;quite a considerable
number of reports were made in triplicates&mdash;some of them went to
ICA, some went to the Yugoslavian Government. I think some went to the
Bureau of Mines here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was nonsecurity work, was it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't have the slightest idea. They checked me,
they gave me some kind of clearance before I went there. Because I had to
wait for quite some time before they gave me the okay. And I noticed that
after I got back from Yugoslavia, they were still checking me&mdash;after I got
back from Yugoslavia they were still checking on me. One character came
to see some of my friends in Dallas and said, "Well, George De Mohrenschildt
is about to go to Yugoslavia. Do you think he is all right?" He said, "But he
is already back from Yugoslavia."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the meantime, you had met your present wife, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I met her in Dallas. And while we were in
Yugoslavia, we became engaged, and she came to visit me in Yugoslavia for
awhile. But she was actually by profession a designer for a Dallas firm of I.
Clark, and she went to Europe on a business trip for I. Clark, and while doing
so she came and visited me in Yugoslavia for a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was not yet divorced at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't think she was divorced. She was getting a
divorce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where had you met her? Were you living at the Stoneleigh Hotel
in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she was living there, also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She was living there, also. And she had this separate
apartment. I was living on the Maple Terrace. She was living at the Stoneleigh
Hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was her daughter with her at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I don't think she was. She came over later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I mean was her daughter living in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; her daughter was living in California.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the name of that town?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Where she lived in California?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Some canyon&mdash;Cayuga Canyon. She can tell you
about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I met my present wife's ex-husband. His name was
Robert LeGon. We developed a liking for each other. I remember he told me
that he will give his wife a divorce if I promise that I would marry her. A
very charming fellow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you and your present wife live with each other before you
were married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, we did, for a relatively short time, because we
couldn't make up our minds whether we should get married or not. We both
had experiences in the past. We decided that we would see if we wanted to
be married or not. And we eventually did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I think you can remember this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In the name of God we were married, because I remember
we went on a trip to Mexico and decided that here we are married&mdash;in
the name of God, we are married. Then, later on, we put it in the name <span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had a civil ceremony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. After your wife had become divorced from her former husband?
His name was Bogoiavlensky?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; but he changed his name to LeGon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Can you spell that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That name was a discovery for me, also. In the
States they used the name of Le Gon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you and your wife married&mdash;by the way, her given name
is Jeanne, is it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you and she married, did you continue to live at the
Stoneleigh, or did you take up residence somewhere else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No, we kept on living at the Stoneleigh for awhile,
and then we took a house in University Park, on Thackery. We took a house
because both our daughters came to live with us. Actually, her daughter lived
with us a little while before, and then my daughter came to live with us. She
came from France to live with us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mentioned her daughter. Now, you make reference to your
daughter. That is your daughter Alexandra?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she had been living in France?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She had been&mdash;she was brought up by her aunt in
Arizona, because her <span class="locked">mother&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And her aunt's name is what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Nancy Clark&mdash;and eventually she became Nancy
Tilton III. <span class="locked">Anyway&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She lives where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She lives in Valle Verde Ranch, near Tucson, Ariz.
And that is where my daughter was brought up. She was brought up and
spent most of her childhood in that place, with her aunt and her husband, Mr.
Clark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Her aunt's husband?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is the daughter by your marriage to Miss Pierson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right. Her mother, more or less, left her
with&mdash;it was with what we call her aunt, because it is a European way&mdash;that
was her first cousin, so, therefore, we call it an aunt&mdash;my daughter's aunt. I
guess in English you would call it a cousin. We call it an aunt&mdash;whether it is
cousin, second cousin or third cousin, it is still an aunt. Anyway, she calls
her "Aunt" also. And she spent practically all her childhood there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you visit there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; very frequently I went to visit her there, as
often as I could. And Mrs. Clark and her husband wanted to adopt her. So
we had a litigation there. I objected to her adoption.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your former wife consent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Which one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To the adoption?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, for awhile she was willing to accept that adoption,
because she was not interested in her any more. She lived away from her,
and married somebody else. She was not interested in the daughter.</p>

<p>I objected to that adoption, and very fortunately, because eventually both my
ex-wife and myself had to ask back for the custody of Alexandra because her
aunt became an alcoholic and became an impossible person to live with. And
Alexandra asked me and her mother to take her away from her. We had a
lawsuit&mdash;not a lawsuit, but whatever you call it&mdash;a custody case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where was this, in Tucson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No, that was in Palm Beach&mdash;because Nancy took
Alexandra with her to Palm Beach, and tried to keep her away from us. And
we caught her there in Palm Beach and eventually the judge decided that she
should be with us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was this?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That was in 1956.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you say "with us." Who do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I mean either with me or with the mother&mdash;with the
mother who became Mrs.&mdash;what a complication&mdash;Mrs. Brandel&mdash;my ex-wife, the
the mother of my daughter Alexandra, became Mrs. Brandel. Her husband is a
Dutchman who lives in France and in Italy, and is a television producer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So your ex-wife, Dorothy <span class="locked">Pierson&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. And myself&mdash;asked the judge to decide with whom
our daughter should stay. And she asked to stay with me. But I was not
married yet. This was in the time between the marriages. I was not married.
I could not offer her a home&mdash;although I wanted her to be with me.</p>

<p>And then the judge said, "Well, you go with your mother to France."</p>

<p>And that is what she did. She went to France, stayed with her mother, I
contributed to the support. She stayed there for, I think, a year and a half,
and decided to come to stay with me in Dallas later on.</p>

<p>That is why we had the house on Thackery. She lived with us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She did come to live with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. After you were married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. She lived with us in Dallas for quite some
time.</p>

<p>And, finally, she eloped from <span class="locked">school&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From what school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Highland Park School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, and married a boy from Dallas by the name
of Gary Taylor. She is divorced from him now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was last September, was it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, last September.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">And&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. They have a little boy by the name of Curtis Lee
Taylor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And who has custody of that child?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. The boy has the custody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Gary Taylor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Maybe I am wrong on that. Maybe they have a
divided custody. But the child right now, according to my information, is
with Gary Taylor and with Gary's mother, Mrs. Taylor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Gary has remarried, did you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. I keep in touch with Mrs. Taylor, find out what
is happening to the child.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You say you keep in touch with Mrs. Taylor. Which Mrs.
Taylor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Mrs. Taylor, Gary's mother, who, more or less, takes
care of the little boy right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Following that divorce, your daughter&mdash;what did she do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She went to school, to Tucson, to <span class="locked">study&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What school is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Some secretarial school. And from then on, the
situation becomes vague to me, because I was already gone. I get occasional
reports telling that she left school, that she is somewhere in New York right
now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Has she remarried?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Not as far as I know. I am trying to get in touch
with her right now.</p>

<p>The last address is in some small town in New York, working in a hospital.
She always wanted to be a nurse. Supposedly she has a job as some sort of a
practical nurse in a hospital right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How old is she now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She will be 19 now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your daughter come to know either Lee or Marina Oswald?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. I will get to that, then.</p>

<p>While we are on these children, let's cover, if we might, your present wife's
daughter.</p>

<p>What is her name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Her original name was Jeanne LeGon, the same as
my wife's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There is something indicating that her name was Elinor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. Jeanne Elinor LeGon&mdash;middle name Elinor.</p>

<p>My wife being an ex-dancer, she was a ballerina, had a tremendous admiration
for Eleanor Powell, and named her daughter's middle name after Eleanor
Powell. She was also an admirer of Eleanor Roosevelt, but that is beside the
point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She changed her <span class="locked">name&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your daughter did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Her daughter changed her name from Jeanne to
Christiana, not to be confused with her mother. And the name is hard to
pronounce. She changed it legally, herself, to Christiana LeGon.</p>

<p>Later on, I understand she changed it to Christiana Bogoiavlensky&mdash;whatever
I hear about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is your daughter married&mdash;is Christiana married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To whom is she married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She married Ragnar Kearton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And who is Ragnar Kearton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Ragnar Kearton is a young man from California,
from San Diego, Calif., whose mother I know, and whose father I don't know,
but I understand he is vice president of Lockheed Aircraft Corp. And Ragnar
is a well educated fellow, went to London School of Economics, but never
graduated. He is a freelance writer, painter. To make a living I understand
he works for Lockheed for awhile, and also he buys yachts, repairs them,
fixes them up, and sells them.</p>

<p>Lately they moved to Alaska, and have been living there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Working for the Forestry Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In Alaska?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is Christiana also known as Christiana Valentina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That I don't know. Never heard that name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. After she married <span class="locked">Kearton&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. They changed their name to&mdash;according to them&mdash;to
make it known the fact that her father's name was Bogoiavlensky, and they do
not want to deny the Russian heritage. So that she is very fond of her father,
and she wanted his name to be incorporated in their name, and that was by
mutual agreement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it your understanding that your wife's former husband, Robert
LeGon, married your present wife, and after they were married, they&mdash;his name
was then Robert Bogoiavlensky?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It is my understanding.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And after they were married they changed their name to Le Gon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I understand that when they came from China, they
decided that the name was too difficult to pronounce, and they changed their
name to Le Gon.</p>

<p>I have always known her as Jeanne LeGon, my wife. She is still carrying
that name professionally. She is well known&mdash;she is a well known designer,
she has a name practically as a trademark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She met Mr. Bogoiavlensky in China?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. This is all hearsay, of course, because I was
not <span class="locked">particularly&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She will tell us first-hand tomorrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I understand of her family&mdash;she also has Russian
background. Her father was a director of the Far Eastern Railroad in China,
and she was born in China and lived there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Harbin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, in Manchuria. Lived there until 1938. She
came to the United States the same year I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is a pure coincidence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. We lived right next to each other in New
York, and didn't know each other&mdash;right next door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I understand you are very happily married.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. At last.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, your wife's daughter, Christiana, she is where, at the
present time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Right now she is in Copenhagen, Denmark, with her
husband.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. They came to visit us in Haiti.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I was about to ask you that. When did that take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. They came to stay with us in December.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And January 1964?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And where does your daughter live when her husband is in
Alaska?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She was in Alaska with him. They lived both in
Anchorage and in Valdez. That is where the earthquake took place&mdash;in both
places.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But they are presently vacationing or traveling in Europe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do they have any children?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. They have no children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What are Mr. Kearton's interests?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Interests in life? Or professional interests?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, give me the professional ones first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Professional&mdash;he is&mdash;my wife will tell you more about
him, although I know him pretty well, also, and I like him. He is of ultra conservative
tendencies politically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Please explain that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In other words, he is for Senator Goldwater, 100
percent. His father is a friend of Goldwater's. <span class="locked">And&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, is he an <span class="locked">aggressive&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Very aggressive fellow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is he aggressive politically?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Likes to discuss it, but I don't know whether he has
any actual political&mdash;I mean whether he actually works to have Goldwater
elected. But he likes him and freely expresses his admiration for him.</p>

<p>I don't think he is too much of a boy to go around and try to collect votes for
Goldwater. He is too much concentrated on himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does it refresh your recollection that you and your wife, Wynne
Sharples, were married on the 7th of April 1951?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is probably it, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were divorced almost exactly 5 years later, in April 1956?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, that is correct&mdash;5 years. I have the date clearly
in my mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By the way, let me ask you this at the moment: Are you a
drinker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Occasionally, but not too much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This will be all right to state to you on the record. Of all the
people interviewed, everybody said that you were, if anything, a purely social
drinker, they had never seen you intoxicated or close to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It is not true, because I have been drunk many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
times&mdash;not every day, but many, many times. Not under the table, but I have
drunk more than I should.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You said your son, Sergei, had died in 1960.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, in August 1960.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are sure of that&mdash;rather than 1961?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. 1960&mdash;I am pretty sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, what I have might be a misprint.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. My wife will tell you. I am not very good at dates.</p>

<p>But I think it is 1960.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are very good on names, though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, I remember names. Dates I am very poor at.
That death, you know, put me in such a terrible condition of despair, that I
decided, and I asked my wife to go with me on a trip throughout all of Mexico
and Central America, to get away from everything, and to do some hard
physical exercise. At the same time I thought I would review the geology of
Mexico and Guatemala. And it was an old dream of mine to make a trip like
that, but not in such rough conditions as we did it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am going to get into that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. If you are interested, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am just trying to recall where we were when I interrupted
myself.</p>

<p>At this point, tell me your political philosophies.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. My political philosophy is live and let live. I voted
Republican, but&mdash;I am just not interested in politics.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am not thinking of politics in that sense, Mr. De Mohrenschildt,
I am thinking in politics with a capital P.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I think I am a 100 percent democrat, because
I believe in freedom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you talking about individual freedom now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Individual freedom. And I believe in freedom of
expressing myself when I feel like it. I believe in freedom of criticizing something
which I think is not democratic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is your attitude towards communism?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Towards communism, I wouldn't like to live in a
Communist regime, I am not a Communist, never have been one. But if somebody
likes it, let them have it. And I get along very well with fellow workers
who are Communists. For instance, in Yugoslavia, I got along very well with
them. Of course, we didn't discuss politics very much out there. On the contrary,
you have to stay away from that subject. But I consider the other person's
point of view.</p>

<p>If somebody is a Communist, let them be a Communist. That is his business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I do not try to propagandize him, and I see some
good characteristics in communism.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There are some indications that you have expressed that view
from time to time during your lifetime while you are in this country, that there
are some good qualities in communism.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, there we mean&mdash;or what do you mean? What is your
concept of communism?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I am looking at communism more or less more from
the economic point of view. I think it is a system that can work and works,
and possibly for a very poor man, and a very undeveloped nation it may be a
solution.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A temporary one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. A temporary one, yes&mdash;which eventually, and I believe
in evolution, and I have seen through my life that communism in certain
places has developed into a livable type of an economy, a way of life.</p>

<p>Now, I repeat, again, that I would not like to live there. Otherwise, I would
be there. Because I am too independent in my thinking, and I like business
to be free. <span class="locked">But&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You like individual freedom and free enterprise?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which you find in the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And while you can see some benefits in communism as to persons
of limited means, and poor countries, for initial development, you think that
for a higher level of economic or cultural development communism is not good?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I don't want to put words in your mouth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Exactly.</p>

<p>Now, I am very much influenced by a book called "Poor Countries and Rich
Countries," by the editor of the Economist in London, which expresses my ideas
on economics of the world as it is today.</p>

<p>It is a book which says that&mdash;which is available any place here&mdash;which says
that the world today is divided into poor countries and rich countries, and that
the question of communism and socialism is for ignoramuses. That freedom
can exist in both types of economies&mdash;could exist eventually.</p>

<p>But the main problem of countries today is the richness and the poorness.
Now, the rich countries are all of Western Europe, the United States, Canada,
all of the satellite countries of Soviet Russia, Soviet Russia, Australia, and
so on. Those are the countries which are producing more than they can eat&mdash;you
see what I mean? And they develop the tools to produce industrial goods.</p>

<p>While the other countries, the rest of the world, is falling down in the morass
of poverty, and becomes poorer and poorer as time goes on. You see what I
mean?</p>

<p>Right now, I am living in one of those countries temporarily, Haiti, which is
in terrible economic condition because people eat more than they can produce.
Now, what can save those countries?</p>

<p>Either a tremendous injection of money from the capitalist countries, or a
Communist regime, or a Socialist regime. What else can they do? So that is
something to think about and worthwhile reading.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But, on the other hand, as far as your political philosophy is
concerned, the thing that stands major with you is individual freedom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right. Naturally, you can see from all my
life that I believe in individual freedom, and I could not live without it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Sometimes to excess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. To excess; yes. The big discussions I had in Yugoslavia
was always about the freedoms. And I remember that I was attacked
one day by a group of Communists in Yugoslavia about Governor Faubus, in
Arkansas&mdash;saying "What happens there? Is that an example of democracy
in Arkansas?" And I told them, yes, it is an example of democracy. I told
them that you can imagine in your own country that the Governor would
object to the order from the President, and the President had to send troops
to make the Governor obey. And that made an impression on them. A few
examples like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you were in Yugoslavia, then, you did have debates with
the Communists?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Occasionally&mdash;after a few drinks, you can talk to
them. But they were engineers and geologists&mdash;they were not people active politically&mdash;they
were not big shots.</p>

<p>With the big shots you cannot discuss it. But with smaller people, you can
discuss.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you interested in debate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Very much so; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you inclined in order to facilitate debate to take any side
of an argument as against somebody who seeks to <span class="locked">support&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is an unfortunate characteristic I have; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that leads you at times to not necessarily speak in favor of,
but to take the opposite view of somebody with respect to communism?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; sometimes it annoys me to have somebody who
does not know anything about conditions anywhere else in the world attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
while he is himself actually a Communist. You see what I mean? A Communist
to me, in a bad sense, is somebody who does not believe in free discussion. So
it annoys me that somebody Bircher will tell me, "George, we are for freedom
here." I said, "Just the opposite, you are not for freedom."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is, you have taken the position that the Bircherites are
not for freedom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't like that movement personally. I dislike
it very much. I have run into trouble lately in Texas before I left with some
of my clients who were very much inclined in that direction.</p>

<p>For instance, they object to the United Nations. They put words in my mouth.
I remember one day they said, "George, would you believe in abolition of the
Army in the United States and creating an international force?"</p>

<p>I said, "No."</p>

<p>He said, "Well, that is what the United Nations stands for."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I get sometimes into heated discussions and sometimes
I say things which maybe you don't think. But I may have insulted some
other people's feeling, because I don't have a hatred against anybody. I don't
hate communism&mdash;hell, let them live.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't hate it for somebody else, but you don't want it
yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't want it myself; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your whole stay in Yugoslavia, however, was in connection with
the International Cooperation Administration?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I am glad that you reminded me of that. I developed
an idea, being in Yugoslavia, of forming a joint venture to use Yugoslav
workers and American equipment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What workers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yugoslav workers, who are very good and very inexpensive,
to do some drilling in Arabic countries, and using American equipment.
One of my clients is John Mecom in Houston, who, among other things,
controls Cogwell Oil Well Equipment Co. in Wichita, Kans. And he has been
having a hard time selling his equipment lately. So one day we were discussing
in Houston what could we do to promote the use of his equipment. And we
came to a conclusion that it might be a good idea to form a joint venture,
American-Yugoslav joint venture, using cheap Yugoslav labor, and very good
labor, to drill in Arabic countries, because there is a great future of doing this,
you see.</p>

<p>And John Mecom sent me to Yugoslavia in 1958 to look at the possibility of
forming such a venture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. Was this the same year you were in Yugoslavia for
the <span class="locked">International&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; the next year. This was in 1958.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you then married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had married your present wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I think so. I hope I am right on my dates.
Yes&mdash;I think we were married then. Anyway, I went by myself to Yugoslavia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think you married your wife, Jeanne in 1959, did you not, in
the summer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. You are probably right. Maybe I was not married
at that time. Now, don't take those dates 100-percent sure. I can correct them
later on when I look at the papers. My mind was so busy with Oswald that
I don't keep my mind on the dates of marriage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I haven't reached Oswald yet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I know. It will be a long discussion. I think I
expressed my point of view pretty well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I do want you to get into this 1958 Yugoslav venture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us more about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. All right.</p>

<p>John Mecom said, "George, you go to Yugoslavia and fix a contract for me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
to use the American equipment in conjunction with Yugoslav labor, and possibly
use some Yugoslav engineers, to drill in Arabic countries&mdash;especially in Egypt."
This is a little bit beside the point. But Marshal Tito is very close to Nasser,
and it is very easy to send Yugoslav workers to Arabic countries today, and they
actually do it all the time. They send the workers there, they do some jobs
there. And they use German equipment, and sometimes Italian equipment. So
why not use American equipment?</p>

<p>I heard about the very big deal in Egypt that could be gotten with that type
of combination. However, before going to Yugoslavia I went to see the ex-head
of ICA here in Washington. He was Ambassador in Yugoslavia when I
was there. Riddleburger. And I told him about this project. And I asked him,
"Do you think it will be workable? Will it be acceptable in Washington?"</p>

<p>And he said, "I think that sounds like a good idea."</p>

<p>It is nothing terrible to form a joint American-Yugoslavian venture&mdash;form a
corporation.</p>

<p>I went to Yugoslavia and did get a contract of that type, a contract in the
form of an agreement to be signed later on, just a project.</p>

<p>I came back to Texas, discussed it with Mr. Mecom, and he said, "George, I
have changed my mind. I don't think I would like to do business with those
damned Communists."</p>

<p>So the project fell through. And eventually quite a few corporations of that
type were formed, between the French and the Yugoslavs, Germany and Yugoslavs,
and Italians and Yugoslavs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were in Ghana in 1957, was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think later than that. I think 1960, probably, or
1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What led you to go to Ghana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I have clients in New York by the name of Lehman.
The first name is Rafael Lehman, who owns the Lehman Trading Corp. I have
done some work for him in Texas. A wealthy man of American and Swedish
origin, who owns, among other things, stamp concessions all over Africa. They
have rights to issue stamps for the Government. And this is one of those ventures
that are very profitable, because they practically give the stamps gratis
to the Government, and sell the stamps to the philatelic agents. And he has,
I think, about 11 African countries under contract to produce stamps for them.
And one of them is Ghana.</p>

<p>And while there&mdash;he travels around Africa all the time&mdash;he found out that
there were some oil seeps in the northern part of Ghana, indications of oil.
And he asked me to go there and investigate. And eventually we took a concession
in the northern part of Ghana. We still are supposed to have it, this
concession.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it published when you went to Ghana that you were a
philatelist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. When we arrived in Ghana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Explain that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That was a trick, because I was representing the
philatelic agency, Lehman, but we did not want to let it be known to Shell Oil
Co. that I was a consulting geologist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Don't you think Shell Oil Co. would know that George De
Mohrenschildt was an oil geologist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, we didn't want it to be known, anyway, because
I even didn't go through&mdash;I didn't spend any time in Accra. I went right
away to the northern provinces. How did you know that I went as a philatelist?
You have to say that sometimes in the oil business you use certain tricks.
But that was intentional on the part of Mr. Lehman, because Shell Oil Co. is
supposed to have the real entry to all those countries, as far as concessions go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did this venture of yours in behalf of Lehman Trading Corp.
have anything&mdash;was that political in any nature, and I say political with a
capital P.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; of course they have to be friendly with Nkrumah,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
because they produce stamps for him. But that is the only affiliation they
have with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So this venture in Ghana had no political aspects whatsoever?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was entirely and exclusively business, as you have explained?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. A hundred percent business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Except that you were working for the International Cooperation
Administration when you were in Yugoslavia first, that had no political,
capital P, implications whatsoever?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; it was purely business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your second venture in Yugoslavia for the Cardwell Tool
Corp., that was strictly business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No politics involved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you ever been in any respect whatsoever an agent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Never have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Representing&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Never, never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. You can repeat it three times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No. I could take what you call the fifth amendment,
but, frankly, I don't need to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I should say to you, Mr. De Mohrenschildt, that any time you
think that your privacy is being unduly penetrated, or that you feel that your
constitutional rights might be invaded, or you feel uncomfortable, you are free
to express yourself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. You are more than welcome. I have never been an
agent of any government, never been in the pay of any government, except the
American Government, the ICA. And except being in the Polish Army&mdash;$5 a
month.</p>

<p>Well, maybe I made a mistake. Maybe I am working for the Haitian Government
now. It is a contract. But it has no political affiliations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Subject to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Again, no political angle to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What I am driving at&mdash;whether you work for a foreign government
or not, whether you ever have in your lifetime&mdash;have you at any time had
any position, which I will call political, in the capital P sense, in which you
sought to advance the interests of a movement or a government or even a group
against a government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Never have. Never was even a Mason. Never part
of any political group.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And any views you have expressed during your rather colorful
life have been your personal views?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Personal views; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Not induced or fed or nurtured by any political interests, with a
capital P, on behalf of any group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right. Sometimes I criticize things, like in
Texas&mdash;I criticize the lack of freedoms that the Mexicans have, the discrimination,
and things like that. But nobody pays me for that. I say what I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whether they pay you or <span class="locked">not&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I have never been a member of any group of any
kind. My life was too busy, as you can see, in order to be involved in anything
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, we covered your two Yugoslav ventures, your Ghanian
venture&mdash;the time that you had the company when you were a young man in
Europe, traveled around Europe.</p>

<p>We covered all your employments in the United States, from the time you
came here in May of 1938.</p>

<p>I think we have reached the point of your great venture which you started
to tell us about, and I had you hold off&mdash;your trip down into Mexico and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
Central American countries&mdash;tell us about that in your own words, how it came
about, and what you did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I started explaining that already, that it is
not a new idea for me. I said before that 20 years before, Roderick MacArthur
and myself set out on a limited trip of this type, when we were both young
men in Mexico.</p>

<p>And I have always been interested in Mexico as a very rich country mining
wise, and I thought that it would be very interesting and useful for me to take
a trip along the old trails of the mining of the Spaniards as they went through
Mexico during the days of the Conquistadors.</p>

<p>You see, the Spaniards went to Mexico for the purpose of finding mines, and
the routes they made in Mexico and through Central America are all directed
toward certainly logical prospects, certain mines. And I started collecting
through the years&mdash;I started collecting information on routes of the Spaniards
in Mexico.</p>

<p>But I never thought I would really be able to do it, until came the time in 1960
when my boy died, and I was in very&mdash;practically out of my mind, because this
was my only son. And I said to hell with all that&mdash;I had some money saved up,
and I said I am going to stay away from my work and from the civilized life for
1 year, and I am going to follow the trails of the Spanish Conquistadors, all
throughout Central America, and possibly all the way to South America.</p>

<p>And to do it the hardest possible way, because I believe in physical therapy
for your mental problems.</p>

<p>And my wife, fortunately, also, loves the outdoors, and agreed with me that
that is something we should do.</p>

<p>We gave up our apartment, I gave up my office, and we set out from the
ranch on the border of Mexico and the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What ranch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. This was&mdash;that is the ranch which belongs to a friend
of ours. It is called the&mdash;it is Piedras Negras. It is on the Mexican side of
the U.S. border. On the American side you have a little town called Eagle Pass.
On the Mexican side you have Piedras Negras.</p>

<p>There we have some very close friends who own a big ranch. Their name is
Tito and Conchita Harper. They have&mdash;they are half Mexican, half Americans.
They live on the ranch nearby, and in Piedras Negras.</p>

<p>By the way, when I was visiting them, at the time I was visiting them, a
few months before, we heard about the death of my boy, right in their house.
We were sitting in their house when there was the long distance call from
Canada that my boy had died. They are very, very close friends. They also
advised me that it would be a good thing for me to take a trip like that, knowing
my interest in Mexico and my interest in the outdoor life.</p>

<p>And that is what we did. We started off at the first 200 kilometers&mdash;Tito
took us in a plane to cross the first range, a very difficult range, and the rest of
the trip was made on foot, all the way to the Panama Canal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All the way to where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. The Panama Canal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me what countries you passed through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. We passed through the whole of Mexico, in the
longest trajectory you can have. Then the whole of Guatemala, the whole of
San Salvador&mdash;El Salvador, rather, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and
Panama.</p>

<p>And on the way there we stopped occasionally in towns, received our mail,
through the American Embassy and consulates, visited some of the friends we
have out there. In other words, we led a life close to nature for a whole year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you in Mexico City during this trip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; because our route kept us away from Mexico
City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At any time during that trip was Mikoyan in Mexico?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Oh, yes. That I have to tell this incident; that is
interesting. This is completely a different incident.</p>

<p>I went to Mexico City, I guess, with&mdash;a year before that, on behalf <span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just a minute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. This is another consulting job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you make your walking trip through Mexico?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That was the end of 1960 and 1961&mdash;all of 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That took about 8 months?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Almost a year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So you would return in the late fall of 1961?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. November, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, the occasion when Mikoyan was in Mexico was some other
occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. A different occasion; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As long as we have raised it at this point, we might as well complete
it. Tell us about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. About this Mikoyan incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I went to Mexico City on behalf of Texas
Eastern Corp., which is a gas company in Houston, which has a contract with
the Mexican Government for the purchase of gas. In other words, this corporation
is buying gas from Mexico at the border.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We talk about gas here&mdash;we are talking about natural gas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Natural gas; yes. And this contract was in jeopardy&mdash;somebody
else wanted to take it. And Texas Eastern, which is the
corporation, a very large powerplant corporation which has the Big Inch from
Texas to the east&mdash;through their vice president, John Jacobs, asked me to go to
Mexico, since I am familiar with the country, and try to figure out in which
way we can keep that contract. And while in Mexico, we had to entertain all
the officials of the Mexican Government.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You say "we."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. My wife went with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your present wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did this take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It was&mdash;I think it was in 1959. I cannot swear you
about the dates. But about 1959. Or early in 1960&mdash;one or the other. I went
to Mexico on other jobs before, many times. But this particular job, since you
are interested in the Mikoyan deal, which you call it, was this <span class="locked">particular&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did I say deal or incident? I think I said incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Incident. Anyway, one of our friends in Mexico is
the pilot of the president&mdash;the personal pilot of the President Mateos of Mexico.
He also took the Russian group, the Russian engineers, with Mikoyan, on the
tour of Mexico, at the same time I was there.</p>

<p>By the way, our proposition of the Texas Eastern was to provide some financing
for Pemex in exchange for this contract&mdash;which is the Mexican Oil Co. And
the Russians were offering the same thing to the Mexicans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So you were then really competing with the Russians?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Competing with the Russians. And through my contacts
with this pilot, and with the Mexican officials, I knew exactly what the
Russians were offering. We did not make any particularly big fight about it,
but we knew what they were offering, and we knew what we could offer for our
contract. It was one of the most interesting jobs I ever had.</p>

<p>And then one day, Mikoyan was with that group&mdash;the rest of them were
technicians. One day Mikoyan was leaving. I remember we had dinner the
night before with this pilot of the president. And he said, "George, why don't
you come with me to meet Mikoyan tomorrow at the airport?"</p>

<p>I said, "By God, that sounds like an interesting idea. I would like to meet the
character."</p>

<p>He had such a publicity of being an excellent businessman, I wanted to learn
something from him.</p>

<p>So I said, "All right, I will go with you."</p>

<p>And my wife said, "George, you better not go, because your people at Texas
Eastern will look at it&mdash;they may look at it in a very peculiar manner, if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
appear with Mikoyan"&mdash;and the Texas Eastern people&mdash;they are very conservative
Texas people&mdash;if I appear in public with Mikoyan, I will not get any jobs
from them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Particularly having in mind your Russian background?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; particularly my Russian background. So she
says, "I better go instead of you."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; so the next morning she went with the Mexican
major, the pilot of the president&mdash;he still is a pilot for the president today,
and he is married to an American&mdash;he is not a Communist, believe me. And he
and Jeanne went together to the airport.</p>

<p>It was full of security officers&mdash;the Russian security officers and the Mexican
officers. And the Mexican pilot let her go through all that mess.</p>

<p>Here was the Russian plane, and Mikoyan was making a speech. After that,
the pilot took Jeanne, for the hell of it, and said, "I will introduce you to
Mikoyan."</p>

<p>And Jeanne went to him and said in perfect Russian, "How are you, Comrade
Mikoyan? Nice to know you." And he almost collapsed, because it was such a
surprise for him that somebody went through all that security officers without
being detected&mdash;because she was right there in that group. So she said&mdash;he
asked her where she is from, and she says, "I am from Texas."</p>

<p>"What do you mean from Texas?"</p>

<p>She said, "Yes, I am from Texas." She said, "Why don't you come and visit us
in Texas and I will give you a Russian dinner."</p>

<p>And Mikoyan said, "Thank you very much, some day I will come and see you."</p>

<p>So here was the Mikoyan incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is all of the circumstances of the so-called Mikoyan
incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was pure happenstance and a bit of fun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you, in fact, declined the same invitation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I declined to go&mdash;purely for business reasons&mdash;because
I didn't want my clients to think that I was buddy buddy with Mikoyan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, this trip of yours down through Mexico, and the Central
American countries&mdash;wasn't that about the time of the Bay of Pigs invasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It was indeed; yes. And we didn't know anything
about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You didn't?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. We didn't know anything about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your trip had nothing whatsoever to do with that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Nothing to do with it&mdash;except I remember we arrived
in Guatemala City, and by God you know we walked on the street, we were trying
to get some visas to get to the next country&mdash;you have to get visas and permits
to carry guns. We had to carry a revolver with us to protect us, because
we were going constantly through a jungle. We did not follow any roads.
We were all the time following the trails.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The old Conquistador trails?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; we carried two revolvers and a shotgun with us,
And to be able to cross the border you had to get permit each time. That took
us in Guatemala City quite some time. We were walking around the town
trying to get a permit to Nicaragua, and to San Salvador, and to Honduras. And
as we were walking on the street we saw a lot of white boys, dressed in civilian,
but they looked like military men to me.</p>

<p>And I said to Jeanne, "By God, they look like American boys."</p>

<p>The consulate&mdash;we received our mail through the American consulate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In Guatemala City?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Everywhere&mdash;Guatemala City, San Salvador&mdash;not
Honduras, but in San Jose&mdash;everywhere we received our mail through the consulate
or the Embassy. And I was asking the help of the consul there&mdash;could
they help me to get a permit to go to Honduras and carry my shotgun there.</p>

<p>He said, "I am too busy today, I cannot do anything for you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
And then we left Guatemala City&mdash;2 days later&mdash;we read the paper on the
road about the Bay of Pigs invasion. That is all we knew about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you do on your trip through Mexico and the Central
American countries?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, we took&mdash;I took&mdash;we walked and found our way
by the map, spoke to the people, collected samples.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Samples of what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Samples of rocks, of various rocks that seemed to
<span class="locked">have&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did you carry it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. We sent them back&mdash;we carried&mdash;all the stuff we
carried on the back of a mule. We had a big mule that could carry 150 pounds.
This whole thing is recorded in a book I have written. It is a manuscript I
have&mdash;600 pages&mdash;day for day description of our adventures. If you are interested,
I will give it to you. The publishers don't seem to be interested. It is
now in the hands of a publisher in France, and they may publish it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I had heard about that. I heard if it had a little more color it
might be salable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It is a little bit too dry. It is day by day&mdash;that
is what I could do. Someday when I have more time, I will make it a little bit
more colorful. But as it is now, it is a diary of our trip, day by day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. You see, that took quite some time each day to record
what I saw, to record the geology, to record the observations I had of each
place. Because we went to places that no white man has ever been in before,
in many places. And certainly no geologist had ever visited before. We had
some fascinating adventures. We were attacked many times. We were robbed.
But we always came out all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you make movies of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. We have a movie made of it, which I have here with
me, because I would like to show it&mdash;I showed it to many friends in Dallas and
in New York. It is an 8 millimeter movie which has about 1,200 feet&mdash;three
big reels. This movie seemed to be quite interesting to people who like the outdoors.
It gives you a complete sequence of our trip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you get pretty native in the course of that trip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, we became completely native. We ate only
what the natives ate. We drank what they drank. And we returned to civilization
only once in awhile when we were in towns, in the big cities. Otherwise,
we lived exactly like the natives. And that is how we were able to make a
trip like that. We looked like Indians. They thought that we were Indians
from somewhere. We were poorly dressed. All our cameras and equipment
was covered by a piece of old rag, on top of that mule. In other words, we did
not want to show to the people that we had money with us&mdash;we did carry money
with us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where did that trip end?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. The trip ended exactly at the Panama Canal. At
the end of the trip, we went to say hello to Mr. Farland, the U.S. Ambassador
there. And we also met Mr. Telles, our Ambassador in Costa Rica. They know
all about our trip. And there were many articles written about our trip in the
local papers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean local in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Local in Dallas&mdash;and local papers in Central America,
small local papers. It was a purely geological trip, plus a desire to be away
from civilization for a while because of the death of my son. That, I think, is
sufficient reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It has no political implications whatsoever?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No political implications. I am not interested at
all in politics. Naturally, when I was going there I could not help seeing what
was going on. The dictatorship in Honduras, the civil war in Panama, the
guerilla fights. But it is all recorded in my book.</p>

<p>But I had nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You went from Panama to where?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. We just arrived from the border of Texas to Panama.
We performed one big chunk of&mdash;we covered a big chunk of territory which
is about 5,000 miles, on foot. And, believe me, not many people can do it, you
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you completed that <span class="locked">trip&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. When we completed this trip, we were very tired,
and we decided to go and take a rest in Haiti.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why did you select Haiti?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, as I said before, I had been there many times
as a tourist. I have a very close friend of my father's who lived in Haiti.
I speak French. And I like the country. I said we are going to visit this old
man, a friend of my father's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Mr. Breitman; Michael Breitman. He used to be
a very wealthy man in Russia&mdash;also involved in the oil industry in Russia, and
in Czarist Russia&mdash;a friend of my father's. And I discovered that he lived in
Haiti sometime in 1946 and 1947 when I went as a tourist there. And we
became very close. He considered me almost like his son.</p>

<p>We went to visit him&mdash;I was worried that he might die, and he died very
soon after our trip. And we stayed there for 2 months, relaxing, taking it easy.
And I started preparing my contract with the Haitian Government at the same
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Already then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then you already had in mind the venture you are now&mdash;in
which you are now engaged?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. I already started then, you see. I made the
first step. I received a letter&mdash;I still have it&mdash;the letter from the Minister
of Finance&mdash;that they are interested in my project, which the project is to
review all the mining resources of Haiti. They don't have anybody to do that.
And we kept on working on it, working and working and working, corresponding
back and forth, until finally there was the contract in March 1963. In other
words, it took me 2 years to get that contract.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Here, again, this is all business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Purely business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No political or like considerations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have never been a member of any subversive group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; never have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of what groups have you been a member? And of what groups
are you a member?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I am not a member of any group. Maybe that is
something against me, because I am not a member of any group. I am not
a member&mdash;I am not interested. I am too busy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are a member of the Petroleum Club in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. If you call that a group; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is a group.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; a member of the Dallas Petroleum Club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me all the societies or groups, whether you call them political
or otherwise, of which you have been a member.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. None political. You call the Dallas Petroleum Club
political?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I am a member of the Dallas Petroleum Club.
I used to be a member of the Abilene Country Club. I used to be, because
I don't live there any more.</p>

<p>I am a member of American Association of Petroleum Geologists.</p>

<p>I am a member of the American Association of Mining Engineers. I think
my dues are due. Maybe they expelled me by now.</p>

<p>I am a member of the Dallas Society of Petroleum Geologists.</p>

<p>I am a member of the Abilene Society of Petroleum Geologists. I am a registered
petroleum engineer in Colorado. That is about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
Purely professional organizations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you ever participated in the affairs of&mdash;whether you have
been a member of&mdash;irrespective of whether you have been a member of, I should
say&mdash;any political action group, even such things as the American Civil Liberties
Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; never even knew that it existed. I never even
knew it existed.</p>

<p>You can see very clearly, I did not have time to do that. I am not interested
in it. I told you before, I am not interested in politics, except when I want
to improve something in our way of life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In our own way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In our own way of life, then I start criticizing.
But I certainly am not interested in somebody's political organization, because
I am sufficiently independent to do it by myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And even when you become interested, as you suggest, in improvement
or change, that has been largely an individual activity on your part?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. Occasionally I write letters to Congressmen&mdash;if
you call that political action. I do. I write, I bitch very often. I write
letters to the Congressmen and complain. I know the Congressman from Texas
here, and I know&mdash;I write letters to people in Washington when I want to have
something done about something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, you spent 2 months in Haiti.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you returned to the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Returned to the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where did you land?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. We landed in&mdash;we came by Lykes&mdash;Lykes Line ship
directly from Haiti to Louisiana, I think Port Arthur, La.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Lake Charles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Lake Charles.</p>

<p>And the friends met us there and drove us back to Houston and then to Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who were your friends that met you there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. The friends there were two employees of Kerr-McGee
Oil Co., by the name of George Kitchel, vice president, and Jim Savage, engineer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had known Jim Savage for some time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you had known Kitchel for some time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We are now into 1962, are we?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the early part of the year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you returned to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. We returned to Dallas. We took another apartment
in the same place&mdash;very close to the same neighborhood we used to live&mdash;6628
Dickens Avenue. I felt an urge to write a report on our trip. I sat down and
worked like hell writing this report. My wife started working&mdash;because we were
getting short of money. We spent all the money on our trip&mdash;including this
Haiti stay. And at the same time I started pursuing my profession and making
oil deals like we do, doing consulting work, in Dallas.</p>

<p>Now, I should repeat again&mdash;I am glad you reminded me of some of those
dates, because you have them written down, and I don't.</p>

<p>So I cannot vouch for some of the dates.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, as a matter of fact, I have most of them in my head at the
moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. You have a better memory for dates than I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now we have you in 1962. Your wife went back to work <span class="locked">for&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She had broken her contract with a very large
manufacturer. She had a very good contract&mdash;to come on this trip with me.
She gave up a job of $15,000 or $20,000 a year, to go on this trip with me. And
she had a very hard time reestablishing herself in her profession of designer.</p>

<p>So we went through a rather difficult time there for a year, and she started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
working in the millinery department of Sanger-Harris in Dallas. It is a large
department store in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, this brings us to the summer of 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, in due course you met Marina and Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, before we get to that, what I would like to have you do for
me is tell me about what I will describe in my words, and you use your own,
the Russian emigre group or community or society in Dallas at or along about
that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. There I knew them all, because both my wife
and I like to speak Russian, and we like Russian cooking, mainly. This is our
main interest in Russian society. They are all of the same type&mdash;in other words,
they are all people who carry memories of Russia with them, and who became, I
think, perfect American citizens.</p>

<p>Some of them are a little bit to the left, others are a little bit to the right, but
all within the limits of true democracy.</p>

<p>One of them is, I think, leaning towards excessive rightist tendencies.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He is a geologist, for Sun Oil Co. His name is Ilya
Mamantov.</p>

<p>I know them all very well. They are very decent people, all of them.</p>

<p>He, I think, is a little bit too much again on this Birch Society group, because
he works for a large company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To refresh your recollection as to some of these people. Voshinin.
What is his first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Igor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Mamantov's mother-in-law, Gravitis&mdash;Dorothy Gravitis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I just met her once or twice&mdash;hardly spoken to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The Clarks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I know them very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Max Clark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, Max and his wife, Gali.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Gali is of Russian derivation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Russian descent, born in France of the upper society
in Russia&mdash;she was born Princess Sherbatov. They are families better than
Cabots and Lodges here in the States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What about Mr. Clark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Mr. Clark is a Texan of an excellent background, who
is a lawyer, as you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A lady by the name of Khrystinik?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That I don't know. I don't know her. Maybe you
don't pronounce correctly her name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That may well be.</p>

<p>Paul Raigorodsky?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He is another Russian who is very successful in
business, a Republican, a good friend of mine, I think. For years and years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Let me see some others that come to my mind.</p>

<p>Mr. De Mohrenschildt, I made a mistake with respect to one name. I said
it was Khrystinik. I was in error. It is Lydia Dymitruk.</p>

<p>You are acquainted with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Very slightly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What I am directing my attention to now, sir; is people forming
part of the Russian, what I call, community in the Dallas, Fort Worth,
Irving area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. and Mrs. Ray. Mr. and Mrs. Frank Ray, and Mr. and Mrs.
Thomas Ray.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. I think she is Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Either one of them&mdash;the one who is in the advertising
business.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. George Bouhe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He is a leader of the community, is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. John and Elena Hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is their history?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, she <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I mean derivation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He is American.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He is a native American. And she <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She is a Russian, I think of Persian origin, or
brought up in Persia. I am not so sure where she was born. But she speaks very
good Russian. She is I think Greek Orthodox, which means of Russian
parentage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tatiana Biggers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. The name sounds familiar to me, but I don't think
I know it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. and Mrs. Teofil Meller?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Peter Gregory and his son, Paul?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I know only the father, Peter Gregory, not the son.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. and Mrs. Declan Ford?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, I know them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does my calling your attention to the few people I have named
refresh your recollection as to others who are part of the Russian community?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, there are others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am thinking primarily of the Russian group who met the
Oswalds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't know who of them might have met the
Oswalds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What about Sam Ballen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He is an American, but he knows a few Russians.
And he met Oswald just once, I guess. I think he is a good friend of Voshinin&mdash;of
mine, and probably knows the Fords. I don't think he knows the others.
Maybe he does. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Having in mind this group of <span class="locked">people&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, then the priest must know them all&mdash;the
Russian priest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He is an American, but he is a Greek Orthodox priest
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Father Dimitri.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Father Dimitri&mdash;he is from Houston, is he not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No, he is the one who is in charge of the Greek
Orthodox Church in Dallas, and he is also a professor at SMU, professor of
Spanish at SMU.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In that connection, there are <span class="locked">two&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I know that he knows Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There are two Greek Orthodox Churches, are there not, or sects
or groups, in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me how that developed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, it is just some sort of schism in the Greek
Orthodox Church. I am not too interested in religion, so I could not tell you
how it originated. But anyway, one church seems to be purely Russian, and
the other one seems to have a lot of Americans in it. The one that Father
Dimitri is the head of&mdash;he is an American and quite a large membership of
Americans&mdash;they have converted. And the services are in English, although the
others&mdash;some services are in Russian also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
Sometimes he has visiting priests. But I don't know why they are segregated
into two groups.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr Raigorodsky is interested in the old guard group, let us call
it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; probably, that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And also Mr. Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; but Raigorodsky supports also the other group.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; he does.</p>

<p>Now, are the acquaintances largely formed, when new people come into Dallas,
through these church groups?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; most of the time I would say so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, at least during the time&mdash;I don't know what your propensities
are at the moment, but you were somewhat irreligious when you were
in Dallas, were you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I actually contributed to this church, to the
formation of that first church, that Raigorodsky was interested in, the old guard
church.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. And I actually organized even a choir. But then I
got less interested in it. I didn't like the priest, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You didn't like Father Dimitri?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; the previous one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I forgot his name. He is in South Africa now.
It was some time ago. It was 10 years ago maybe. He was sent to South Africa.
Let them convert the Negroes there, in South Africa.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It has been said or reported by&mdash;from a few sources, during the
course of your lifetime that you were an atheist; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I am more or less an agnostic. I would not
call myself an atheist; an agnostic. I do not believe in organized religion.
Sometimes if I see a group like that, like the Russian group there, I wanted to
help them a little bit to be together. And it is amusing to meet those people.
So I contributed a little money and a little bit of my time for the services&mdash;for
instance, as I said, to sing in the church. But I do not go for going every
Sunday to church, if that is the answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. And especially I do not believe in trying to convert
people&mdash;constantly they push to convert people. But I go occasionally&mdash;on some
holidays I go to church, to be with them, and to see the group, because I like
many of those people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That attitude on your part, of agnosticism, whatever you have
explained it to be, I take it does not arise out of any interest or belief in
communism?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Communists <span class="locked">are&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Communism is a religion, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, that is what they say, in any event. They seek to stamp
out religion as we understand it in Russia, do they not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I understand that the Greek Orthodox Church
is prosperous in Soviet Russia, quite prosperous. Maybe that is the schism
that they have in the church, the schism between the two&mdash;maybe one of those
churches is closer to the Communist Greek Orthodox denomination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But this is speculation on your part?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; this is speculation on my part. I don't know
for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you are an ebullient person, you like to mix with others?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; not always, you know, because I can stand
for a year to be in the jungle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; I appreciate that. But when you are in, let us say, Dallas
or other towns, and in your own community, you are an ebullient person, you
are gregarious, you like to be with people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; exactly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is suggested by some people you are also unorthodox in your
social habits.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; probably. What do they say&mdash;what do they
mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, you are prone to be a <span class="locked">little&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Shock people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Shock people; yes. That is generally so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And why do you do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, it is interesting to see people's reaction&mdash;if
you shock them, it is amusing to get people out of their boredom. Sometimes
life is very boring.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And get you out of your boredom, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Maybe my boredom also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. But generally people like to be asked provocative
questions and to be given provocative answers. I think so, at least.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are a man&mdash;I will put it this <span class="locked">way&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I hope so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You like to have fun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There has been some suggestion that maybe you could be a little
more serious-minded?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It certainly has been suggested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It has even been said you might grow up a little bit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you are fun-loving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; that is right. That I am. Well, I don't believe,
you know, in leading a life as if you were half dead. Might as well enjoy
it, your life, to the fullest extent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am trying to paint a picture here, Mr. De Mohrenschildt, of
the milieu or background in Dallas when you first met the Oswalds, what kind
of a community it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How you moved around in it, and what part you played in it,
and what part your wife played in it. I gather that the community of which
you speak, the people of Russian derivation, were close, you saw a good deal
of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; it is close because there are not many. It
is not like New York&mdash;although in New York I know also thousands of Russians,
and in Philadelphia, and so on, and so forth. But mainly in Dallas
there are only maybe, as you know, 30 families, maybe 25 families, all in all.
So they are a little bit closer together. And a very pleasant relationship&mdash;because
they are all good people&mdash;and with a few exceptions I think we all like
each other, and used to get along very well, until Oswald appeared on the
horizon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. I want to get to that.</p>

<p>I want this to be as spontaneous on your part as possible, rather than
coming by any suggestion from me. Would you try and put in your own words
this Russian community as it was when Oswald and Marina came to the
Dallas area, Fort Worth, in June of 1962&mdash;without involving them now. What
was the milieu and the background of the situation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, a purely social group, a little bit divided by
classes. You see what I mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. There was a little differentiation in classes there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Go ahead and tell us about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In other words, people with good education and
a little bit more money rather were together, and it is not so much a question
of money as a question of good education, and of background. And Bouhe comes
from an excellent family. This Gali Clark, of course, comes from a No. 1<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
family of Russia. Paul Raigorodsky comes from an excellent family, excellent
education. Those were the people with whom we were very close.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there a man by the name of Zavoico?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is his first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Basil.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He lives in Connecticut now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He is a wealthy man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Relatively wealthy man, well-to-do. He has had
many, many, many years&mdash;many more than all of us, in the oil business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Never part of the community?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. We all knew him. Because there are so few people
in this geological field. And he is an old acquaintance of mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, there was a Professor Jitkoff in Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is his first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't remember. I just met him once or twice.
I know his wife better.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is his wife also a Russian emigre?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think she is of Armenian, or Russian and Armenian,
extraction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In what connection did you meet him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Already a long time ago. Oh, yes; I met him
through another Russian, through ballerina, a Russian ballerina, another one
who lived there&mdash;Natasha Krosofska, a famous ballerina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am thinking of another name in Dallas, Mrs. Helen Leslie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; that is her stepmother&mdash;the stepmother of
the ballerina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was part of the Russian group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; also from a typical old guard family&mdash;really
hundred percent. To show you the atmosphere&mdash;who does not believe there
are any new houses built in Russia today? She said in her opinion the Russia
of today doesn't have any new houses, none whatsoever&mdash;only the old palaces
from the czarist days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I interrupted you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. The really backward type old guard people. I
am glad that you made such a distinction there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is this old guard group a group that would be inclined to believe
that if an American went to Russia and came back with a Russian wife, that
that necessarily would mean that he must have had some connections of some
kind with the Communists in order to get a Russian wife out of Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is an interesting question. They might believe
anything, because they think that the Russians are such devils that they
would go to any extent of diabolical combinations to do something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, among the Russian emigre group in Dallas, did you ever
know of anybody that you even thought might be a Communist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Not a single one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or have any leanings toward communism?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; no leanings even. I am probably the most
leftest of them all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you do <span class="locked">not&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. And as you know, I am not a member of any party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you do not regard yourself as a Communist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No. Not only do I not regard&mdash;I just am not. But
I am probably the only one who has been in the Communist country, because of
my job with ICA, and also, I forgot to tell you that I had visited Poland in 1958,
after my job with ICA. I went to visit Poland, as a tourist, to see what happened
to my ex-country. I just went there for a period of 10 days, to Warsaw,
and then went to Sweden from there, and then returned back to the States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was <span class="locked">after&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. After I finish my job in Yugoslavia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Give me&mdash;I am going to pose a hypothetical to you. Let us assume
that a Russian couple would come to Dallas, let us say right now&mdash;no
friends, not know anybody in Dallas. What would normally happen? As soon
as you became acquainted with the fact, or the community&mdash;the Russian group
became acquainted with the fact that there was a Russian couple?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. They would be exceedingly interested, naturally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Curious?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Exceedingly curious.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, if you were there, would that include you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. Well, aside from us&mdash;the most curious would
be George Bouhe, because he actually met us first&mdash;the first in Dallas&mdash;he told
us about Oswald, as far as I remember. Because he is curious by nature. He
wants to know what is going on. He wants to convert them to the Greek Orthodox
Church, and so on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would there be any effort to help these people become acquainted
throughout the community?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. If they&mdash;if that couple came from Soviet Russia,
from the Soviet Union, you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, let's assume that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, the old guard would not do anything. They
would be curious, but&mdash;they might meet them and very soon afterwards they
would get disgusted with them, because what they would say to them would
not fit with their beliefs. And we know that Soviet Russia is a going concern.
To them it is not, it does not exist. It just isn't there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, when did you first meet either Marina&mdash;I will
put it this way: When did you first <span class="locked">hear&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. The first <span class="locked">time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of either of these people&mdash;Marina Oswald or Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. As far as I remember, George Bouhe, who is a close
friend of mine, and a very curious individual, told me that there is an interesting
couple in Fort Worth, and that the Clarks know them already&mdash;Max Clark
and Gali&mdash;they know them already. Somebody read about them in the paper&mdash;I
don't know exactly, I don't remember the exact wording any more&mdash;that somebody
read about them in the paper, maybe Mr. Gregory, and discovered them,
made a discovery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. But we heard from George Bouhe the first time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At this time were you aware that there had been an American
who had gone to the Soviet Union and attempted to defect to the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that he had returned to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is what I heard from George Bouhe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was the first you ever knew anything at all <span class="locked">about&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I never heard about them, never heard anything
about them before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, is that likewise true of Mrs. De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Same thing. I think we were both together when
this conversation took place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did it take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I could not tell you the date. I think in the summer
of 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, give me your best recollection of what George Bouhe said
to you about the Oswalds on that occasion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He said rather a complimentary account of them&mdash;I
don't think he met them yet. I think he just heard about them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is your recollection he had just heard about them, and heard
she is very pretty, and comes from an excellent family&mdash;supposedly. And he is
a fellow who got disappointed in Soviet Russia and returned to the United States,
and that met with George Bouhe's approval&mdash;somebody who did that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't think he even knew that he had been an
ex-Marine, and all that. I don't think he knew anything about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When George Bouhe spoke to you then&mdash;have you exhausted
your recollections as to the conversation right at that point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I am trying to think about it. I just remember that
I got curious, what kind of a fellow he is, and what kind of a woman she is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you particularly interested when you heard she was pretty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No, no; not particularly. No; because&mdash;but it is nice
to know a good-looking girl rather than to know some monster.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You <span class="locked">have&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I am always curious to find somebody better looking
than horrible. We are talking about serious things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, it is part of the atmosphere, Mr. De Mohrenschildt. You
have always had an interest in pretty women, have you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Sure, sure; naturally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have pursued and courted them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I still do, I hope. Until the day I die. But anyway,
it was not really so. It was just an interesting couple who were&mdash;it
pleased us to know that here is a pretty girl from Soviet Russia that had arrived,
because we all picture Soviet Russian women like a commando&mdash;big, fat
women, working in a brick factory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were curious to find out more about them, were you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Again, now, my recollections are a little bit vague
on that.</p>

<p>I tried, both my wife and I, hundreds of times to recall how exactly we
met the Oswalds. But they were out of our mind completely, because so many
things happened in the meantime. So please do not take it for sure how
I first met them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We want your best recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. My best recollection&mdash;I even cannot recall who gave
me their address in Fort Worth. I don't recall that. Either George Bouhe
or the Clarks, because the Clarks knew them already, Max and Gali Clark,
because they were from Fort Worth, you see.</p>

<p>And I think a few days later somebody told me that they live in dire poverty.
Somewhere in the slums of Fort Worth.</p>

<p>I had to go on business to Fort Worth with my very close friend, Colonel
Orlov.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is his first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Lawrence Orlov&mdash;he is an American, but he has a
Russian name for some reason&mdash;maybe his great-grandfather came from
Russia.</p>

<p>And to my best recollection, Lawrence and I were on some business in Fort
Worth, and I told him let's go and meet those people, and the two of us drove
to this slum area in Fort Worth and knocked at the door, and here was Marina
and the baby. Oswald was not there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was during the daytime?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Late in the afternoon, after business hours, 5 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You and Colonel Orlov?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Colonel Orlov.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She answered the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You identified yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I said a few words in Russian, I said we are
friends of George Bouhe. I think he was already helping them a little bit,
giving them something for the baby or something. I think he had already been
in&mdash;he helps everybody. He has been helping her especially. And so the introduction
was fine. And I found her not particularly pretty, but a lost soul,
living in the slums, not knowing one single word of English, with this rather
unhealthy looking baby, horrible surroundings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now we are interested in a couple of things. You found that she
knew substantially no English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No English at all at that time. I think she knew
maybe&mdash;I remember that I asked her, "How do you buy things in the store," and
she said, "I point with my finger and I can say 'yes' and 'no'." That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you go into the home&mdash;was it a house or apartment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It was a shack, near Sears Roebuck, as far as I
remember&mdash;near that area. I don't know if you went down there. A little
shack, which had only two rooms, sort of clapboard-type building. Very poorly
furnished, decrepit, on a dusty road. The road even was not paved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you talk to her about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Just asked her how she likes it here, and how she
was getting along, does she get enough food, something like that&mdash;completely
meaningless conversation.</p>

<p>And I think Lawrence was there, you know, but he did not understand what
I was saying. He doesn't know Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ask about her husband?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I said, "Well, I would like to meet your husband."
She said he should be back from work soon. She asked me to sit down,
offered me something to drink, I think&mdash;she had some sherry or something in
the house. This is the best of my recollection.</p>

<p>And Lawrence sat down, and found her very nice. And then after a little
while, Oswald, Lee appeared.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You say Lee appeared?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, Lee appeared.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Lee appeared. You had never seen him before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Never seen him before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He came in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What happened, and what was said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, he loved to speak Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you introduce yourself? And explain why you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, I said, "I'm a friend of George Bouhe, I want
to see how you are getting along."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you speak in Russian or English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In English at first, and then he switched to Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your impression of his command of Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, he spoke fluent Russian, but with a foreign
accent, and made mistakes, grammatical mistakes, but had remarkable fluency
in Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was remarkable?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Remarkable&mdash;for a fellow of his background and education,
it is remarkable how fast he learned it. But he loved the language.
He loved to speak it. He preferred to speak Russian than English any time.
He always would switch from English to Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you discuss life in Russia, how he got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't think the first time. I don't think the first
time I said anything at all, you know. Possibly he told me that he had been
in Minsk, and that got me curious, because I had lived in Minsk as a child,
and my father was the so-called nobility marshal of Minsk. He got me curious,
you know.</p>

<p>But I do not recall for sure whether it was the first time I met him or the
second time or the third time. I don't remember. I think it was a very short
meeting the first time, because Lawrence Orlov was there, and he wanted to get
back home, so we just said, "Well, we will see you," and possibly Marina had
mentioned that her baby needed&mdash;that she needed some medical attention with
her teeth, and that the baby had not been inoculated. Possibly that was that
time. But I am not so sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At least there was a time when that did arise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Her need for dental care, some attention needed to be given
to the child?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your impression was the child looked rather on the sickly side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; very much so. It was kind of a big head,
bald big head, looked like Khrushchev, the child&mdash;looked like an undergrown
Khrushchev. I always teased her about the fact that the baby looked like
Khrushchev.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I don't want to prod you, because I want you to tell the story
in your own words.</p>

<p>Now, you had this visit, and you returned home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think the first visit was very short, and we drove
back with Lawrence, and I remember on the way we discussed that couple,
and both had a lot of sympathy for her especially. But he also struck me
as a very sympathetic fellow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. Give me your impression of him at that time&mdash;your first
impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. The first impression and the last impression remain
more or less the same. I could never get mad at this fellow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Sometimes he was obnoxious. I don't know. I had
a liking for him. I always had a liking for him. There was something charming
about him, there was some&mdash;I don't know. I just liked the guy&mdash;that is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you reached home, you reported on <span class="locked">this&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. You know, he was very humble&mdash;with me he was
very humble. If somebody expressed an interest in him, he blossomed, absolutely
blossomed. If you asked him some questions about him, he was just out of this
world. That was more or less the reason that I think he liked me very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; he did. It is so reported, and Marina has so said.</p>

<p>Well, that first visit didn't give you any opportunity to observe the relations
between Marina and Lee, I assume?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I already noticed then that the couple&mdash;that they
were not getting along, right away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What made you have that impression?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, there was a strained relationship there. You
could feel that. And, you know how it is&mdash;you can see that the couple&mdash;that
they are not very happy. You could feel that. And he was not particularly
nice with her. He didn't kiss her. It wasn't a loving husband who would come
home and smile and kiss his wife, and so on and so forth. He was just indifferent
with her. He was more interested in talking to me than to her. That type of
attitude.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you did notice throughout all your acquaintance with him
that he blossomed when you paid attention to him, let us say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You drew him into conversation or situations&mdash;especially when
you asked something about him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; exactly. I think that is his main characteristic.
He wanted people to be interested in him, not in Marina. And she remained
quite often in the background.</p>

<p>Later on, even in conversation she would remain in the background, and he
would do the talking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he have an arrogant attitude?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; with me he has never been arrogant. Even
when we came to the incident, you know, when we took the baby away from him,
and Marina away from him later&mdash;you know that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I want to get that in sequence. But you did it yourself, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. My wife and I; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, why do you not just go along and tell me as things develop.
And how attitudes changed, and everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, then we started getting reports, you know, from
George Bouhe and the Clarks about them. We didn't see them very often.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Please, I don't want you to say you didn't see them very often.
Maybe you didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I want to know how this developed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When next did you see them, after this initial event?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That I don't remember. I don't remember. But I
do know that we saw Marina very soon afterward, because either my wife went
to get her or my daughter went to get her&mdash;I don't remember that any more&mdash;to
take her to the hospital. Or maybe George Bouhe brought her to our house
so that my wife, who was free at the time, could take her to the dental clinic. I
think that was the next time that we saw Marina. Maybe a few days later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In any event, it was before Marina went to live with the Mellers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it was before Marina went to live with the Taylors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>She never lived with the Taylors. I think she spent 1 night with them, and
that is all. She lived, I think&mdash;I think both of them lived somewhere in the
neighborhood. I think she spent 1 night with my daughter, when she happened
to be in Dallas for this medical care. And since they are about the age of my
daughter&mdash;she is a little bit older, but about the same age&mdash;I don't remember
how it happened, but either I or my wife introduced Marina to my daughter,
and also Lee. This is very vague in my mind, what happened there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, your recollection is that within a few days George Bouhe
brought Marina to your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For the purpose of having your wife take Marina to get some
dental care?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And where was she taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She was taken to the Baylor Dental Clinic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is located where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It is right in the center of Dallas, near the Slaughter
Hospital&mdash;what a name for a hospital. It is the name of the man who founded
it.</p>

<p>Well, the dental clinic is right there next door. They give you dental care
gratis, or almost for nothing.</p>

<p>George Bouhe was giving her money, by the way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was giving her money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I mean small amounts of money, you know, either for
injections or something like that&mdash;because she didn't have anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was destitute, was she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Completely destitute&mdash;because Lee was at the time
losing his job. I don't recall when he told me that&mdash;maybe already at the first
meeting. He told me that he was about to lose his job. He was working somewhere
in Fort Worth as a manual laborer, some ironworker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Leslie Welding Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I don't know the name of it. This company
was going bankrupt, or that he was going to lose his job. At least that was his
version. Maybe he was fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was his version. That wasn't the fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It was a fact?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was not. Your wife also took the baby for some medical care?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Now, this I am not so sure. She told Marina where
to go, and told her, "You have to give the baby such and such injections." And
this I remember well&mdash;that she didn't do it. She didn't go to that children's
clinic, because of pure negligence. She is that type of a girl&mdash;very negligent,
poor mother, very poor mother. Loved the child, but a poor mother that doesn't
pay much attention. And what amazed us, you know, that she, having been a
pharmacist in Russia, did not know anything about the good care of the children,
nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did you find out she had been a pharmacist in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, that eventually came&mdash;the second time or the
third time that we met her&mdash;she told us the story of her life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have a recollection as to what she told you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. Well, she said exactly her story of her life
as she told me, that she comes from a family of ex-Czarist officers. That her
father had been a Czarist officer of some kind&mdash;you see what I mean? I don't
remember whether it was navy or army. I don't recall it any more. That her
mother remarried, and that her stepfather did not treat her well. That they
moved&mdash;I think they lived in Leningrad when she was a child. That eventually
they moved to Minsk. I don't remember what her father's profession was.</p>

<p>One thing I remember&mdash;that one of her uncles was a big shot Government
official, something like that&mdash;colonel or something like that. That I remember
she told me.</p>

<p>And then she went to this school of pharmacists, I think in Minsk, and graduated
as a pharmacist. And one day she was walking by this river, which I also
remember, in Minsk&mdash;the River Svisloch, which crosses the whole town, and
where there are some new apartment buildings built, and in one of those apartment
buildings there were very nice apartments, and that is where the foreigners
lived.</p>

<p>She said it was her dream some day to live in an apartment like that. And
that is where Lee Oswald lived. And eventually when they met&mdash;I remember
they met at some dance&mdash;I think he was ill, something like that, after that dance,
and she came to take care of him. That is something I have a vague recollection
of&mdash;that she took care of him, and from then on they fell in love and eventually
got married. But she said it was the apartment house that was one of the
greatest things she desired to live in, and she found out later on that Lee Oswald
lived in that apartment house, and she finally achieved her dream.</p>

<p>It sounds ridiculous, but that is how in Soviet Russia they dream of apartments
rather than of people.</p>

<p>She told us a tremendous amount of things which will come to me as things
go on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Naturally I was talking to her and to him&mdash;I was
trying to find out what is life of young people in Soviet Russia, what are the
prices on food, what can you get for your money, what salary you get, what
amusements you get.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us what they said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. The salaries&mdash;she was getting an equivalent of $60 a
month. He was getting something like $80 a month. That almost all of it had
to be spent on food. The lodging was very cheap, almost nothing, because it
was provided by the Government. That the food was rather plentiful, you could
get it&mdash;but it was rather monotonous. Sometimes you could not get meat.
They used to have discussions between them all the time&mdash;always they quarreled
about&mdash;Lee Oswald and Marina always quarreled between themselves as
to what actually were the prices, what actually were the conditions of life in
Soviet Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me about the differences here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The attitudes she had, and the attitude he had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He liked Russia more than she did. I think he liked
the conditions in Russia more than she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Because he was a foreigner there, and he had a
privileged position. He had a nice apartment. He said that people were interested
in him, you see. That very often&mdash;he worked in a TV factory&mdash;the
workers would come to him and ask him questions about the United States and
so on, and that pleased him very much, because he was that type of an individual
who needed attention.</p>

<p>Marina was more inclined to criticize the living conditions there than he did&mdash;as
far as I remember. Yet she was not too critical, you see. It was a livable
way of life.</p>

<p>Actually, they came to think that possibly their life was better there than in
Fort Worth. In other words, both were disappointed in what happened to them
after they came back to the United States. And I think that Lee more than
Marina. Because as the time went on, Marina was getting more and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
things from people&mdash;people like the Clarks, like ourselves, like George Bouhe,
started giving her gifts, dresses and so on and so forth. She had some hundred
dresses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A large number of dresses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. About a hundred dresses.</p>

<p>When we carried them out to live with the Mellers, my car was loaded with
her dresses. It was all contributions from the various people, in Fort Worth
and Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In addition to dresses and clothing, what other things?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, mainly baby things. She had two cribs, I remember.
She had a baby carriage.</p>

<p>I think George Bouhe gave it to her. Toys for the baby. Many things like
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you say you carried her out and took her to the Mellers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. This was already possibly 2 weeks after we met
them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, what was the occasion that you did that, and why did you
do it?</p>

<p>That was a pretty forward thing to do, was it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. In the meantime, Lee lost his job and George
Bouhe told him that he should move to Dallas, he will give him an introduction
at the Texas Employment Agency&mdash;he knew somebody there. And eventually he
got a job through that Texas Employment Agency. I don't remember the name
of the person who was there&mdash;some Texas lady whom George Bouhe knew.</p>

<p>And I told him that I would help him, too, to find a job, and even spoke to
Sam Ballen about it, can he give him a job. And that is probably the only time
that Sam Ballen met Oswald. I told him to go to Mr. Ballen's office&mdash;he has a
reproduction business, a very large one in Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Reproduction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Reproduction, electric log reproduction service.
When they reproduce electrical logs from the oil wells. And also, they print
catalogs and things like that in his office. It is quite a large business that he
has&mdash;with branch offices all over Texas, and even in Denver, Colorado.</p>

<p>I said, "Why don't you see if you can give him a job?" And I remember that
Sam saw Lee Oswald and found him very interesting.</p>

<p>I remember I saw him the next day and said, "How did you like Lee Oswald?"
and he said, "Nice fellow, very nice fellow, very interesting fellow."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But he did not have any work for him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He didn't have a job for him. And at the same time
he received a job at some other outfit&mdash;I forgot the name of it&mdash;the traffic outfit,
and they moved from Fort Worth to Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You said you entered and took Marina out of the house, and the
baby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That was a little bit later on&mdash;when he already moved
to Dallas, he already had the job. But now I am trying to recall who moved him
from Fort Worth to Dallas, and I think that was Gary Taylor, my ex-son-in-law,
and Alex, my daughter. I think they both drove to Fort Worth.</p>

<p>I told them to do so&mdash;"Go to Fort Worth and help them, they have no car,
they have no money&mdash;help them to move."</p>

<p>I think in the meantime Lee found a job at Jaggars, and was looking for a
place to live, and found a place to live himself in Oak Cliff, this address which
I don't remember now&mdash;the first address in Oak Cliff. He had two addresses.
I forget the exact address. My wife will remember that.</p>

<p>Anyway, my daughter and her husband went there and moved them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, maybe 2 weeks after we met the Oswalds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. September of 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. About that time&mdash;about September.</p>

<p>A little before that, I think, because in September we started the campaign on
the cystic fibrosis, and we completely lost track of them&mdash;we were very busy on
that. And I think it was in September that this campaign started.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And before you started your campaign on cystic fibrosis, they
had already moved to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. They already moved to Dallas. We already had
moved them&mdash;had taken Marina away from her husband. And she already had
returned back to her husband.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, you say you had already taken Marina away
from her husband. Tell us how that occurred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In the meantime. George Bouhe became completely
disgusted with Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Because&mdash;I don't know exactly why&mdash;because he
liked Marina very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Bouhe&mdash;he is an elderly man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, I appreciate that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He wanted&mdash;almost like a daughter, you see. To
him she was a poor girl whose father was an ex-officer, and she needed help.
And he really gave her money. He would give her $30, $40, I think, all at once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he ever collect money from you and others to contribute?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever give Lee Oswald any money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever give Marina any money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Not as far as I remember. Maybe a dollar&mdash;maybe
50 cents, something like that, for a bus. But never any money. I was in very
difficult financial condition myself at that time. I don't think I gave her even
50 cents.</p>

<p>Sometimes we would invite them to eat a little bit, you see, in the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You invited them to your home to eat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. I think maybe once or twice they came to the
house to eat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your home on Dickens Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, tell us the <span class="locked">circumstances&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Of how we took her away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And why.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, George Bouhe started telling me that "George,
Lee is beating Marina. I saw her with a black eye and she was crying, and she
tried to run away from the house. It is outrageous."</p>

<p>And he was really appalled by the fact that it actually happened. And Jeanne
and I said, let's go and see what is going on.</p>

<p>George Bouhe gave me their address, as far as I remember, there in Oak Cliff,
because I didn't move them&mdash;it was my daughter who moved them, I think.</p>

<p>So we drove up there to that apartment, which was on the ground floor, and
indeed Marina had a black eye. And so either my wife or I told Lee, "Listen,
you cannot do things like this."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he home at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think he was. Or maybe he wasn't. I just am
not so sure. Maybe he was, maybe he wasn't. But anyway, he appeared a
little later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. While you were still there, he appeared?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And when you entered that apartment on the first floor, you
observed that she had a black eye?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. A black eye, and scratched face, and so on and so
forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you inquire about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did she say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She said, "He has been beating me." As if it was
normal&mdash;not particularly appalled by this fact, but "He has been beating me",
but she said "I fight him back also."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
So I said, "You cannot stand for that. You shouldn't let him beat you."</p>

<p>And she said, "Well, I guess I should get away from him."</p>

<p>Now, I do not recall what actually made me take her away from Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, Mr. De Mohrenschildt, there has to be something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, I know.</p>

<p>I do not recall whether she called us in and asked us to take her away from
him or George Bouhe suggested it. I just don't recall how it happened. But
it was because of his brutality to her. Possibly we had them in the house and
discussed it, and I told him he should not do things like that, and he said, "It is
my business"&mdash;that is one of the few times that he was a little bit uppity with
me.</p>

<p>And then again George Bouhe told me that he had beaten her again. This is
a little bit vague in my memory, what exactly prompted me to do that. My
wife probably maybe has a better recollection.</p>

<p>Anyway, on Sunday, instead of playing tennis, we drove to Marina's place
early in the morning and told Oswald that we are going to take her away from
him, and the baby also, and we are going to take her to Mr. and Mrs. Meller.
I think George Bouhe made the previous arrangement, because he was closer to
the Mellers than I was. Or maybe I called them. I don't remember exactly.</p>

<p>Anyway, they were ready to receive her.</p>

<p>And Lee said, "By God, you are not going to do it. I will tear all her dresses
and I will break all the baby things."</p>

<p>And I got very mad this time. But Jeanne, my wife, started explaining to him
patiently that it is not going to help him any&mdash;"Do you love your wife?" He
said yes. And she said, "If you want your wife back some time, you better
behave."</p>

<p>I said, "If you don't behave, I will call the police."</p>

<p>I felt very nervous about the whole situation&mdash;interfering in other people's
affairs, after all.</p>

<p>Well, he said, "I will get even with you."</p>

<p>I said, "You will get even with me?" I got a little bit more mad, and I said,
"I am going to take Marina anyway."</p>

<p>So after a little while he started&mdash;and I started carrying the things out of
the house. And Lee did not interfere with me. Of course, he was small, you
know, and he was a rather puny individual.</p>

<p>After a little while he helped me to carry the things out. He completely
changed his mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He submitted to the inevitable?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He submitted to the inevitable, and helped me to
carry things. And we cleaned that house completely.</p>

<p>We have a big convertible car, and it was loaded&mdash;everything was taken out
of that house. And we drove very slowly all the way to the other part of the
town, Lakeside, where the Mellers lived, and left her there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Lee accompany you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; that was it. The next day or a few days later&mdash;I
don't remember exactly when&mdash;George Bouhe called me and said, "George, you
should not give Lee the address of where Marina is." I think he came to see
me about that&mdash;"because he is a dangerous character, and he has been threatening
me, and he had been threatening Marina on the telephone."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He knew where Marina was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Maybe I am confused a little bit. He knew George
Bouhe's telephone number. He had been threatening him, and wanted to know
the telephone number or the address of where Marina was. And this time my
wife and I said we do not have the right not to let him know where she is,
because she is his wife, and we should tell him where Marina is.</p>

<p>Now, I do not recall how it happened&mdash;maybe Lee came over to our apartment
in the evening. Anyway, we gave him the address of the Mellers, you see,
and told him that the best way for him to do is to call ahead of time if he wants
to see Marina, talk to her on the telephone, and if she wants to see him, she
will see him. And he was very happy about that&mdash;because I thought it was a
fair thing for the fellow to do.</p>

<p>I repeat again&mdash;I liked the fellow, and I pitied him all the time. And this is&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>if
somebody did that to me, a lousy trick like that, to take my wife away, and all
the furniture, I would be mad as hell, too. I am surprised that he didn't do
something worse.</p>

<p>I would not do it to anybody else. I just didn't consider him a dangerous
person. I would not do it to somebody else.</p>

<p>Well, anyway, later on&mdash;this is from hearsay again, now&mdash;Marina moved to
Declan Ford's house, because I think the Mellers got tired of her, and then
she moved eventually to somebody else's house&mdash;the name you mentioned here
before&mdash;a Russian girl who married an American&mdash;Thomas something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Ray?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Ray. She moved to Ray's house, and <span class="locked">then&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. You took her to the Mellers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she went from the Mellers to the Halls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That I do not remember any more. I do not recall
that. I thought she moved from the Mellers to Mrs. Ford, and from Mrs. Ford
to the house of the Rays.</p>

<p>What I recall now is that she had moved before to Mrs. Hall's house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You learned that she had already been at Mrs. Hall's home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Something like that is in my mind&mdash;that she had
already tried to go away from Lee, and stayed with Mrs. Hall. But I am not
100 percent sure.</p>

<p>I know that for the second time she was at Mrs. Hall's house, a little bit later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your understanding of the difficulties they were
having?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Why was he physically beating her?</p>

<p>The difficulties were this: She was&mdash;just incompatibility. They were annoying
each other, and she was all the time annoying him. Having had many
wives, I could see his point of view. She was annoying him all the time&mdash;"Why
don't you make some money?", why don't they have a car, why don't they have
more dresses, look at everybody else living so well, and they are just miserable
flunkeys. She was annoying him all the time. Poor guy was going out of his
mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you and your wife were aware of this, were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And had discussed <span class="locked">it&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. We told her she should not annoy him&mdash;poor guy, he
is doing his best. "Don't annoy him so much." And I think I mentioned before
one annoying thing. She openly said he didn't see her physically&mdash;right in
front of him. She said, "He sleeps with me just once a month, and I never get
any satisfaction out of it." A rather crude and completely straightforward
thing to say in front of relative strangers, as we were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I didn't blame Lee for giving her a good whack on
the eye. Once it was all right. But he also exaggerated. I think the discussions
were purely on that basis&mdash;purely on a material basis, and on a sexual
basis, those two things&mdash;which are pretty important.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; they are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In politics they agreed more or less. She&mdash;they
were both somewhat dissatisfied with life in Soviet Russia. I had that impression.
They wanted a richer life. And as far as I remember, it was
Marina who convinced Oswald to leave Soviet Russia, and go back to the
United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have a <span class="locked">definite&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I have a definite recollection of that. I do not recall
in exact words how it was said. But either one of them told me that&mdash;that
it was Marina who wanted to come to the States, and made him go to the&mdash;back
to the United States Embassy, and ask for his passport. And I remember
very distinctly what he told me, that he illegally took a train from Minsk to
Moscow, because being a foreigner, he was not supposed to leave town without
notifying the police. He did that illegally, and went to Moscow, and presented
himself at the United States Embassy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did it come to your attention, or did he ever say to you that&mdash;even
before he was married, that he had determined to return to the United
States, and had taken some steps to do so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I don't recall any of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your distinct recollection, however, is that she did tell you that
she desired to come to the United States, and she pressed him to do so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; and possibly he was disgusted by that time
also, because he was the fellow who needed attention, he was a new fellow in
Minsk, a new American, so they were all interested in him. And then they
lost interest in him eventually. So he became nothing again. So he got disgusted
with it. And Marina told him, "Let's go back to the States, and you
take me to the States." Now, what is not clear to me&mdash;and I never inquired
into it, because I was not particularly interested&mdash;how she got the permission
from the Soviet Government to leave. That I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You never discussed that with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Never discussed that. Somehow I was not interested
to ask her that question. I should have, possibly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever ask him about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Never asked him this question.</p>

<hr />
<h2>TESTIMONY OF GEORGE S. DE MOHRENSCHILDT RESUMED</h2>

<p>The testimony of George S. De Mohrenschildt was taken at 9 a.m., on April 23,
1964, at 200 Maryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C., by Mr. Albert E. Jenner,
Jr., assistant counsel of the President's Commission. Dr. Alfred Goldberg,
historian, was present.</p>

<p class="p2">(Having been previously duly sworn.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the record.</p>

<p>Mr. De Mohrenschildt, you testified yesterday it was your then recollection that
Marina did not live with your daughter, Alexandra, then Mrs. Gary Taylor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That's right. I think she spent one night with them,
but never lived with them, as far as I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Maybe that's it. Now, perhaps to refresh your recollection,
Marina testified&mdash;this question was put to her. "Did you have anything to do
with the Gary Taylors?" "Answer: Yes; at one time when I had to visit the
dentist in Dallas, and I lived in Fort Worth, I came to Dallas and I stayed with
them for a couple of days."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She probably is right. I think she spent only one
day. But I could not swear to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I want to stimulate your recollection in another respect.
Your daughter has made a statement that in September of 1962, "My father
asked me to allow Marina Oswald and her child to reside with me at my then
home at 1512 Fairmont Street, Dallas. My father explained that Lee Harvey
Oswald and his wife Marina had recently arrived in Dallas, Tex. They had no
money and Lee Oswald was unemployed. He told me that while Marina resided
with me, Lee Oswald would reside at the YMCA." Does that serve to refresh
your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I frankly do not remember. I have the impression
that I said "Help her as much as you can," but I do not recall saying that she
would live with them. I do not think I would have imposed that on my
daughter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, that testimony of Marina that she did live with your
daughter for several days, and your daughter's statement, does <span class="locked">not&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I do not know about it. Maybe they did, maybe
they did not. I just do not recall that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I repeat again that they were out of my mind&mdash;completely&mdash;after
the last time we saw them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, this is September of 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. 1962, sure. They were out of my mind. I forgot the
Oswalds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No; 1962, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No, no. Now the Oswalds were out of my mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean you have not been thinking about them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I have not been thinking about them.</p>

<p>May I say a few things here that I remember? As I told you before, we met
the Oswalds through Bouhe, and then we talked about them to Max Clark, and
again to Bouhe. And I asked Mr. Bouhe "Do you think it is safe for us to
help Oswald?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did have that conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why did you raise that question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I raised the question because he had been to Soviet
Russia. He could be anything, you see. And he could be right there watched
day and night by the FBI. I did not want to get involved, you see. And I
distinctly remember, No. 1, that George Bouhe said that he had checked with
the FBI. Secondly, that in my mind Max Clark was in some way connected
with the FBI, because he was chief of security at Convair&mdash;he had been a chief
of security. And either George Bouhe or someone else told me that he is with
the FBI to some extent. You never ask people "Are you from the FBI?" And
to me it is unimportant. But somehow in my mind I had this connected. And
so my fears were alleviated, you see. I said, "Well, the guy seems to be OK."
Now, I am not so clear about it, but I have the impression to have talked&mdash;to
have asked about Lee Oswald also Mr. Moore, Walter Moore.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who is Walter Moore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Walter Moore is the man who interviewed me on
behalf of the Government after I came back from Yugoslavia&mdash;G. Walter Moore.
He is a Government man&mdash;either FBI or Central Intelligence. A very nice
fellow, exceedingly intelligent who is, as far as I know&mdash;was some sort of an
FBI man in Dallas. Many people consider him head of FBI in Dallas. Now,
I don't know. Who does&mdash;you see. But he is a Government man in some
capacity. He interviewed me and took my deposition on my stay in Yugoslavia,
what I thought about the political situation there. And we became quite friendly
after that. We saw each other from time to time, had lunch. There was a
mutual interest there, because I think he was born in China and my wife was
born in China. They had been to our house I think once or twice. I just found
him a very interesting person. When I was writing this book of mine, a very
peculiar incident occurred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which book?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. The last one&mdash;the travelogue. One day we left for
Houston on a business trip, and I left all my typewritten pages, some 150 typewritten
pages, in my closet. When I returned from the trip and started looking
through the pages, which had not been touched, supposedly, by anybody I
noticed small marks on the pages&mdash;"No. 1" after five pages, "2"&mdash;small marks
with a pencil, another five pages, No. 3, and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>I told my wife "Jeanne, have you fiddled around with my book?" She said,
"Of course not." I said, "That's impossible." And I forgot it for a while.</p>

<p>In the evening we got back home, and we stayed in bed, and all of a sudden
the idea came back to me that somebody must have been in my apartment and
checked my book and read through that and took photographs. And it was such
a horrible idea that Jeanne and I just could not sleep all night. And the next
morning we both of us went to see Walter Moore and told him, "Now, look
what happened to us. Have you Government people"&mdash;and I think I asked him
point blank, you know&mdash;"Have you FBI people looked through my book?" He
said, "Do you consider us such fools as to leave marks on your book if we had?
But we haven't." I said, "Can't you give me some protection against somebody
who has?" He said, "Do you have any strong enemies?" I said, "Well, I
possibly have. Everybody has enemies." But I never could figure out who it was.
And it is still a mystery to me.</p>

<p>So I am not so sure whether I asked point blank Clark or Walter Moore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
about Oswald. I probably spoke to both of them about him. My recollection
is, and also my wife's recollection is, that either of them said he is a harmless
lunatic. Later on Max got disgusted with him and said that he is a no-good
<span class="locked">b&#45;&#45;&#45;&#45;&#45;d,</span> a traitor, and so on and so forth. But by that time we already forgot
Oswald&mdash;got Oswald out of your lives, you see. This is one point.</p>

<p>The second point is as you can see the whole of the Russian colony in Dallas
were interested in Oswald one way or the other, because they represented
somebody who had been to their old country just recently, and could give
them the latest information on what was going on. As I said, the old guard
were naturally against them right away. The others were just curious. But
this particular couple, Natasha and Igor Voshinin, refused to see them. And
I insisted several times, "Why don't you see them? You love all the Russians.
Why don't you meet Marina Oswald?" And she said, "We don't want to, and
we have our reasons for not meeting them." And it kept on in my mind. I
did not want to raise that question. But why didn't they want to meet them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, tell me what is your speculation as to why they did not
want to meet them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I do not have the slightest idea. Maybe they knew
something about Oswald, of some connection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or maybe they were alarmed, and didn't want to take any
chances.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Maybe just that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But they were pretty firm in not having any traffic with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Absolutely firm. The only ones. Maybe they were
just more recently arrived in the United States and they were not so secure
like we were, you see. And possibly they were just alarmed of meeting somebody
who just came from Soviet Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think I will ask you at this point, Mr. De Mohrenschildt, you
are a man of very superior education and extremely wide experience and acquaintance
here and in Europe, South America, West Indies&mdash;you have lived
an extremely colorful life. You are acquainted to a greater or lesser degree
with a great variety of people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did there go through your mind speculations as to whether
Oswald was an agent of anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why? Before I put it that way&mdash;when you say "No," am I
correct in assuming that you thought about the subject and you concluded he
was not an agent of anybody? Is that what you meant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I never thought even about it. I will tell you why
I thought he never was&mdash;because he was too outspoken. He was too outspoken
in his ideas and his attitudes. If he were really&mdash;if he were an agent, I
thought he would have kept quiet. This would be my idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You say he was outspoken. What do you base that on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. For instance, he showed me his&mdash;he discussed very
freely with me, when he showed me his little memoirs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am going to show you those papers in a little while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Those memoirs I think are very sincere. They explain
more or less the sincere attitude of a man, sincere opinion of a man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Before I show you any papers, I want you to finish this reasoning
of yours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I did not take him seriously&mdash;that is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I know you didn't. Why didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are a highly sophisticated person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, he was not sophisticated, you see. He was a
semieducated hillbilly. And you cannot take such a person seriously. All his
opinions were crude, you see. But I thought at the time he was rather sincere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Opinion sincerely held, but crude?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was relatively uneducated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Quite, as a matter of fact&mdash;he never finished high school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I did not even know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have the feeling that his views on politics were shallow
and surface?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Very much so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That he had not had the opportunity for a study under scholars
who would criticize, so that he himself could form some views on the subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Exactly. His mind was of a man with exceedingly
poor background, who read rather advanced books, and did not understand even
the words in them. He read complicated economical treatises and just picked
up difficult words out of what he has read, and loved to display them. He loved
to use the difficult words, because it was to impress one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you think he understood it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He did not understand the words&mdash;he just used them.
So how can you take seriously a person like that? You just laugh at him. But
there was always an element of pity I had, and my wife had, for him. We
realized that he was sort of a forlorn individual, groping for something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you form any impression in the area, let us say, of reliability&mdash;that
is, whether our Government would entrust him with something that
required a high degree of intelligence, a high degree of imagination, a high degree
of ability to retain his equilibrium under pressure, a management of a situation,
to be flexible enough?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I never would believe that any government would be
stupid enough to trust Lee with anything important.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Give me the basis of your opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, again, as I said, an unstable individual, mixed-up
individual, uneducated individual, without background. What government
would give him any confidential work? No government would. Even the government
of Ghana would not give him any job of any type.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You used the expression "unstable." Would you elaborate on
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, unstability&mdash;his life is an example of his instability.
He switched allegiance from one country to another, and then back
again, disappointed in this, disappointed in that, tried various jobs. But he
did it, you see, without the enjoyment of adventure&mdash;like some other people
would do in the United States, a new job is a new adventure, new opportunities.
For him it was a gruesome deal. He hated his jobs. He switched all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, let's assume he switched jobs because he was discharged
from those jobs. Does that affect your opinion? That is, assume now for the
purpose of discussion that he lost every one of his jobs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, frankly, if I&mdash;you always base your opinion on
your own experience. If I had my own country since my childbirth, and my
government, I would remain faithful to it for the rest of my life. He had a
chance to be a marine. Here was a perfect life for him&mdash;this was my point of
view. He was a man without education, in the Marines&mdash;why didn't he stay in
the Marines all his life? You don't need a high degree of intelligence to be a
marine corporal or a soldier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is, it was your <span class="locked">thought&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That was my idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That if he had an objective that he could have had, it would be
to stay in the Marines and become a marine officer, and have a career in the
Marines.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right. Well, instead of that he disliked it
and switched to something else. I do not know the details of all his jobs, you
see, but I certainly can evaluate people just by looking at them&mdash;because I
have met so many people in my profession&mdash;you have to evaluate them by just
looking at them and saying a few words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you form an impression of him, Mr. De Mohrenschildt, as to
his reliability in a different sense now&mdash;that is, whether he was reasonably
mentally stable or given to violent surges of anger or lack of control of himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Of course, he was that. The fact that we took his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
wife away from him, you know, was the result of his outbursts and his threats
to his wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What kind of threats?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, that he will beat the hell out of her. I think
Marina told me that he threatened to kill her. It comes back to my mind, you
see. You asked me yesterday a question, what actually precipitated us taking
Marina and the little child away from Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You actually took Marina and the child away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. So what actually precipitated that? Something
must have precipitated it. I cannot recall what it was. But now I seem
to vaguely remember that Marina said that he would kill her, that he will
beat her sometime so hard that he will kill her. So that is the reason we
went out there and said&mdash;well, let's save that poor woman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where were they living then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. They were living then at the first address in Oak
Cliff&mdash;Ruth Street, I think. It is a two-story brick building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mercedes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Ruth Street. I do not remember Mercedes Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Elsbeth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Elsbeth&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He never lived on any street by the name of Ruth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yesterday you adverted, I thought, to a concept that this man
seemed&mdash;he responded when you would bring him into a conversation or situation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That he was somewhat egocentric in that respect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Very much so. And that is probably the reason
that he was clinging to me. He was clinging to me. He would call me. He
would try to be next to me&mdash;because, let's face it, I am a promotor and a salesman.
So I know how to talk with people. I usually do not offend people's
feelings. When I talk to people, I am interested in them. And he appreciated
that in me. The other people considered him, well, he is just some poor,
miserable guy, and disregarded him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I would like to go into that a moment. It gradually developed,
did it, that the people in the Russian colony, their curiosity&mdash;they
had curiosity at the outset, and they had interest at the outset.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They met him at your home and other homes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it you now suggest that after a while their interest in
him waned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It disappeared mainly; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was it replaced by something else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Dislike, mostly dislike, and fear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the fear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Especially on the part of a scary individual, like
George Bouhe&mdash;he was actually physically afraid of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. George Bouhe was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. George Bouhe. He was actually physically afraid
of him. He told me, "I am scared of this man. He is a lunatic." I said,
"Don't be scared of him. He is just as small as you are."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, but George Bouhe is a small man. You are a well-built,
athletic, six foot-one. What did you weigh then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. 185 pounds. I was not afraid of him, naturally, but
George Bouhe was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is not your nature, anyhow, that is not your personality
as I observe you testifying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; he was that way, you know. Now, Max Clark
naturally was not afraid of him because Max Clark himself is an athlete, an
ex-colonel in the Air Force, I think. He just disliked him, and he said to hell
with that fellow, because Lee was rude to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who was rude?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Lee Oswald was rude to Max Clark and to his wife.
They invited him on some occasion&mdash;this I remember vaguely&mdash;they invited
him at some occasion to come to their house. And Lee said, "Well, I will come
if it is convenient to me." Imagine that&mdash;an answer of that type.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, the Clarks, certainly Mr. Clark&mdash;I do not know too much
about Mrs. Clark&mdash;but Mr. Clark is an educated man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Very educated man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And a man of attainment. He is an attorney, is he not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did it occur to you that here is a person who is relatively uneducated,
of limited capacity&mdash;I think this man had <span class="locked">intelligence&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Being invited to the home socially of a man of capacity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A lawyer, a leader in the community with a fine service record.
What was your reaction to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, Max invited him purely because his wife was
Russian and she would like to speak Russian once in a while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You think Lee resented that, do you&mdash;that the interest was in
Marina and not in Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; definitely. Oh, that is an exceedingly important
point, you know. Lee resented the interest that people would take in Marina.
He wanted the interest concentrated on himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did he exhibit that in your home and at other gatherings
where you saw him? Did he interrupt so that the attention might be drawn
to him and away from her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; he was <span class="locked">not&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I do not want to put the words in your mouth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, I understand what you mean. I am trying to
think of a particular case that I would remember. I do not remember any
particular case, but I always took him and considered him as an egocentric
person. I do not remember any particular incident, but I knew that he wanted
the attention to himself, always. Not in any particular case, but always. And
he would rather disregard what Marina would say. And this is possibly the
reason for his not wanting to&mdash;for Marina to learn English, so she would stay
completely in the background.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you opened that subject which I want to inquire of you
about. Did you people in the Russian colony&mdash;did you consider that? Did
you regard that as unusual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Right from the very first day my wife told Marina,
"You have to learn English, you have to be able to communicate, and especially
since you do not get along with your husband and you are going to leave him
some day&mdash;you have to be able to support your child and yourself. You have
to learn English and start immediately on it." We gave her some records
to study English&mdash;not mine, but my wife's and her daughter's records, of
Shakespearian English, how to learn English, and they obviously still have those
records.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, they were found in Mrs. Paine's home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. We even gave them a phonograph, I think, a cheap
phonograph, to play the records.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You gave them records?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You also gave them an instrument to play them on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. A cheap phonograph, to play those records.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What else do you recall giving them&mdash;dresses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I do <span class="locked">not&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Toys for the baby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Toys for the baby, definitely. And I am sure that
my wife had given some dresses. But she will remember better than I do.
But we never gave them one cent of money. This I recall&mdash;never&mdash;and Lee
would not take money, you see. I might have given him a little bit if he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
asked. But he was very proud about it. He resented when people gave
something to Marina. Marina would take anything, you see&mdash;she would take
anything from 5¢ up to anything. And the more the better. But Lee did not
want to take anything. He had a very proud attitude. That is one of the
reasons I sort of liked him, because of that. He was not a beggar, not a sponger.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you notice over the period of time you knew him developments
of resentment on his part of, say, these people in the Russian colony
who had come here and had established themselves to a greater or lesser degree?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; it was a very strong resentment on his part.
It was almost an insane jealousy of people who succeeded where he could not
succeed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever have any discussions with him on that? How did
you acquire this feeling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That was again through my understanding of human
nature, rather than from direct conversation. From hearsay, rather. You
see, No. 1, for instance, the fact that he was so rude to the Clarks, because
they lived very well. It is an insult in his face, the house that the Clarks
have&mdash;very luxurious home, two cars, and so on and so forth. It is a slap
in his face. This same thing that George Bouhe, a refugee, would give Marina
$30 or $40 or a new baby crib, like that, like nothing. That was a slap in his
face. The fact that I had a new convertible was a slap in his face. But he
was not stupid enough just to say so. But you can feel that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, it might have <span class="locked">been&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. And maybe George Bouhe, unfortunately annoyed
him unintentionally with that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, that might be possible. George Bouhe&mdash;my impression
of him is that he is a direct man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. George Bouhe's intention was to take Marina away
from Oswald very soon&mdash;not for himself, but to liberate her from Oswald.
That is a fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had discussions with George Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; he said, "We have to take this girl away from
him," and this is one of the things that prompted us to take Marina and the
child away from Oswald. We discussed all that with George Bouhe&mdash;to make
her a little bit happier&mdash;maybe she will make another life for herself, and
especially for the baby. I had lost my child, you know, just a year and a half
before, or 2 years before. I am fond of babies. I wanted this baby to be
happy and have some sort of a future.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you discuss with Oswald this subject of Marina acquiring
a greater facility in the command of the English language?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He said, "I don't want her to study English because
I want to speak Russian to her, I will forget my Russian if I do not practice
it every day." These are the words which I remember distinctly. And how
many times I told him, "You have to let your wife learn English. This is a
very egotistical attitude on your part."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Very selfish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Very selfish. He would not answer to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did it occur to you as a possibility, or among others in the
Russian colony, that he might have had another objective, and that is that
she would return to Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Never. That never occurred to me. I do not think
that. Knowing Marina, she would never go back to Russia. She liked the
United States. She liked the facilities of life here. Of course, you never
know people. You cannot vouch for them. But that was our opinion. Maybe
we simplified too much the matters. I do not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did there come a time in the spring or the midwinter of 1963,
latter part of January, and in February, in which there was any discussion,
or you learned that Marina had made application to the Russian Embassy to
return to Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No discussion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No discussion of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And except for my now uttering it, you have been wholly
unaware of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Wholly unaware of it. Totally unaware of that,
never heard of that. What we learned, at that period&mdash;that she had her child
christened in the Greek Orthodox Church against Oswald's strong objections.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you personally aware of those objections?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No. I just heard that he objected to Marina doing
it&mdash;and she took the child to church anyway and had the child christened. But
I do not recall the circumstances. Somebody told me that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you are unaware of any discussion of her returning to
Russia in the spring or late winter of 1962&mdash;1963, that winter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she never appealed to you that he was forcing her to make
application to the Russian Embassy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I do not recall anything of that kind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. De Mohrenschildt, it appears to be the consensus in that
Russian colony, that community, that Oswald reached a point where he resented
all the people other than you; that he had a liking for you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I explained to you that I do not know whether
he had a liking or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or respect, or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I treated him nicely. My wife treated them like
human beings, disregarding their bad qualities. Because that is our way of
treating poor people. My philosophy is&mdash;you may object to that&mdash;but my
philosophy is not to bend in front of the strong and be very nice to the poor&mdash;as
nice as I can. And they were very miserable, lost, penniless, mixed up.
So as much as they both annoyed me, I did not show it to them because it is
like insulting a beggar&mdash;you see what I mean.</p>

<p>Well, the other Russians obviously do not have such a charitable attitude.
I do not think he has ever been, for instance&mdash;I am trying to think whether
he had a resentment against all of the Russian colony or not. I would not
say so. I do not know how was his attitude toward Mr. Gregory. I think they
remained pretty&mdash;not close, but on speaking terms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That seems to be so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Because Mr. Gregory is a very fine person&mdash;very
fine person, who is an elderly man, who is nice to a poor person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your impression is that he, to use the vernacular a little bit&mdash;he
was sort of eating on himself, he wanted to amount to something, and he
appeared to be unable to, and was constantly groping.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. That is his main&mdash;his makeup&mdash;trying to do
something. One conversation I had with him&mdash;I asked him "Would you like
to be a commissar in the United States," just teasing him. And he said&mdash;he
sort of smiled&mdash;you could see that it was a delightful idea. To me it was a
ridiculous question to ask. But he took me seriously. I laughed with the
guy. Sometimes I would laugh, I would tease him. And it was amusing.
But I tried not to offend him, because, after all, he was a human being. And
in addition to that&mdash;in my case we had a point of contact which was the fact
that he lived in Minsk, where I lived when I was a child also, where my father
was this marshal of nobility. And later on in life I lived in Poland, very close
to that area. I was interested in how the peasants were getting along, what
does he find in the forest there, what kind of mushrooms you find, that type
of conversation went on sometimes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he appear to have knowledge and recollection of things in
which you were interested in the community, the countryside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Very much so. That was a likable characteristic
he had. For instance, he liked animals. My dog was sort of friendly with
him. When he would come, my dog would not bark. He liked walking. He
told me that around Minsk he used to take long walks in the forest which I
thought was very fine. Those are contacts that possibly brought a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
understanding between us. He spoke very interestingly about the personalities
of fellow workers there at his factory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I want you to keep ruminating in this fashion, because these
things will come to you. What did he say about his work there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, he said that the work was all right, not too
hard, not too well paid, that it was very boring. That later, after the work, he
had to be present at all sorts of meetings, political meetings. He said he got
bored to death. Every day he had to stay for an hour at some kind of a
meeting, the factory meeting. And this is a thing I thought was very intelligent,
because that is one of the points that is really hateful in a Communist country&mdash;the
meetings after work. That I noticed through my own experience in Yugoslavia,
that the engineers and the plain workers just hated that&mdash;a political
meeting after working 8 hours. And Lee Oswald also resented that in Russia.
And I thought it was a rather intelligent&mdash;-one of the intelligent remarks that
he made. And he repeated that very often&mdash;that is the thing he hated in Russia;
resented, rather than hated.</p>

<p>Well, he described the personalities of some of the people that he knew there
which I do not recall anymore. But some of them nice, and some of them
less nice, and some of them very much interested in the United States, some of
them unfriendly&mdash;that sort of vague recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you engage him in conversation respecting Communism as
a political ideal and his reactions to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He kept on repeating that he was not a Communist.
I asked him point blank, "Are you a member of the Communist Party?" And
he said no. He said, "I am a Marxist." Kept on repeating it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ask him what he meant by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I never frankly asked him to elaborate on that,
because again, you know the word "Marxism" is very boring to me. Just the
sound of that word is boring to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What impression did you get in that connection as to whether
he was seeking some mean or middle ground between democracy and what he
thought Communism was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Possibly he was seeking for something, but knowing
what kind of brains he had, and what kind of education, I was not interested
in listening to him, because it was nothing, it was zero.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. It was your impression, then he could contribute nothing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No, he could contribute absolutely nothing except
for a remark like that about the meetings, which was just an ordinary remark
a person of his intelligence could understand. But when it comes to dialectic
materialism, I do not want to hear that word again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did discussions occur as to his attempted defection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. From the United States to Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. How it happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Why it happened and how it happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. A few words I remember now. He said that while
he was in Japan he saw tremendous injustice. By that he meant, I think,
the poverty of the Japanese working class or the proletariat, as he called them,
and the rich people in Japan. He said it was more visible than anywhere else.
Now, I have never been in Japan, and I cannot vouch for that. But that is
what he told me. And he also told me that he had some contacts with the
Japanese Communists in Japan, and they&mdash;that got him interested to go and
see what goes on in the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just concentrate on this, please. Tell me everything you can
now recall as to what he said about&mdash;you used the term, what we lawyers call
a conclusion. You said he had some contacts with the Communists in Japan.
Now, try and recall what he said or as <span class="locked">near&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I see what you mean. Since it was so removed
from my interest, I did not insist. I just heard that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just give me your best recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is all I recall&mdash;that he said, "I have met some
Communists in Japan and they got me excited and interested, and that was one
of my inducements in going to Soviet Russia, to see what goes on there."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you form any opinion that this man, because of his meager
boyhood, on the verge of poverty, or in poverty all during his youth and up
to the time he went into the Marines at least, that he had some groping for a
ready solution that would not permit that sort of thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Naturally. That's the whole point. I could understand
his point of view, because that is what happens exactly in the whole
world with dissatisfied people. If they are constructive, they study more and
try to get good jobs and succeed. The other try to form a revolutionary party.
And he was one of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The other try to do it overnight, by force of arms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever discuss with him that there are many great men
and women who have come from poverty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Oh, yes. You could not discuss it with Oswald because
he knew it all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He always knew what the answer was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He always knew what the answer was. And possibly
that is why he was clinging to us, to my wife and me, because we did not
discuss it with them, because we did not give a damn. After we found out
what was going on in that town of Minsk, what was the situation, what were
the food prices, how they dressed, how they spent their evenings, which are
things interesting to us, our interest waned. The rest of the time, the few
times we saw Lee Oswald and Marina afterwards, was purely to give a gift,
to take them to a party, because we thought they were dying of boredom, you
see&mdash;which Marina was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She was, because he never would take her any place.
That was the reason we invited them twice&mdash;once to a party at Declan Ford's&mdash;and
that was, I think, a Christmas party. And another time a party at Everett
Glover's, where I was showing my movie to the whole group. Because I thought
they would be exceedingly&mdash;Marina was dying of boredom there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Let me get to that party at Declan Ford's. That was&mdash;was
that a New Year's Day or New Year's Eve party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think it was right at Christmas or New Year's Eve.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The party went on for a couple of days, didn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. A couple of days?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I did not know that the party ran for a couple of
days. But we arrived at 9 o'clock and left around 1 or 2, and it was still going
strong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I suppose when a witness said it lasted a couple of days,
maybe the witness was thinking it started in the early evening of one day and
did not end until well into the next day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; it was not any of those wild parties. It was a
very friendly, very good party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I'm not suggesting the party was wild. There is no intimation of
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No&mdash;on the contrary, they are very hospitable people
invited, and always had a congenial crowd there. And that is why we suggested,
let's bring that miserable Marina and Oswald there, so they would meet some
people. And I think if people continued doing that, if people did that, maybe
this tragedy might not have occurred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or it might have become worse&mdash;his resentment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Maybe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Marina smoke?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. Oh, boy, this is an interesting question. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
loved to smoke and would smoke as many cigarettes as she could lay her hands
on. And you know, Oswald did not smoke and forbade her to smoke. This is
the reason&mdash;one of the reasons they fought so bitterly&mdash;because he would take
the cigarette away from her and slap her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In my presence, would take the cigarette away from
her and push her, "You are not going to do that", in a dictatorial way. So I
would say, "Now, stop it, let her smoke." And then he would relax. But that
is the type of person he was. But not in our presence&mdash;when we were away,
Marina said he would not let her smoke nor drink, I think. He refused to let
her drink either. And she liked to have a drink. With all her defects, she is
more or less a normal person, and rather happy-go-lucky, a very happy-go-lucky
girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What about his drinking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I never saw him drink. Maybe he would take a very
little, but I never saw him drink more than half a glass&mdash;as far as I remember.
I didn't pay too much attention. Maybe that is why he was tense, because he
did not drink enough. He was always tense. That guy was always under some
kind of pressure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have that impression?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; always some kind of a pressure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this was an inward pressure, you thought?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; some inward pressure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. See if I can refresh your recollection a little about that party,
the first of the parties. I am going to ask you about the second one as well in
a moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember being present at that party Mr. and Mrs.
Thomas Ray?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. If they are the people whom I identify as he
being a man in the advertising business and she a girl of Russian origin&mdash;a
friend of Mrs. Ford.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He married her when he was in Germany.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; that's it&mdash;something like that. You know, in
this group of the Russian emigres, there were two people who came from Soviet
Russia&mdash;there were Mrs. Ford and this lady, an entirely different type of
individual&mdash;the new blood. They were younger and they were brought up in
Soviet Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; they were <span class="locked">people&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. They were so-called&mdash;what do you call&mdash;displaced
persons, who were grabbed by the Germans and displaced in Germany, and then
the American soldiers grabbed them and married them. Both of them were
the same type. Very nice people, but they had a different background.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, this party occurred on the 28th and 29th of December.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. As far as I remember, it was around New Year's
Day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it was at the Declan Fords?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was George Bouhe there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Mr. and Mrs. Meller?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think so, too. And a lot of other people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There is another Ray couple, Mr. and Mrs. Frank Ray.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That I do not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. and Mrs. C. E. Harris?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I do not recall them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Charles E. Harris?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think I recall this person. He is a tall man with
grayish hair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From Georgetown, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. A tall man with grayish hair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. His wife was Russian born.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't know them well. I probably would recognize
them if I saw them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were there some people by the name of Jackson at that party
who had a very lavish house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Jackson? I know a Jackson who has a very lavish
house. He is a geologist also. But I do not recall seeing them at the party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There is some testimony that in the early morning hours the
party adjourned to the Jackson's house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, we had already left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. John and Elena Hall. They were there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I do not recall that. I met them, I think, only
once&mdash;I met her twice or three times. I recall her pretty well. But I do
not recall him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tatiana Biggers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is the person I could not identify. I don't
know who she is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Also present, Lydia Dymitruk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think so. I think I remember her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A single person, divorced.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I think I remember her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Slightly built, slender, short.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I remember her. She was married to some
"cuckoo nut," another "cuckoo nut" who escaped from Soviet Russia&mdash;Dymitruk.
He came to ask me for a job, her husband. He came to ask me for a job several
times, and then he disappeared.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Lydia Dymitruk's husband?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; her ex-husband. I understand she is a very
nice person, very hard working, and is making a living for herself, and that
she left him. That is my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You brought the Oswalds to the party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">And&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Having asked previously either myself or my wife&mdash;having
asked Mrs. Ford would she mind having the Oswalds, because they
seemed to be bored to death, especially Marina seemed to be bored to death.
And she said yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And after a while you folks left, around midnight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you take the Oswalds with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think we did. And this is the reason why&mdash;because
I think they left the child in our house while they came to the party,
and we asked another friend of ours, an elderly lady, Mrs. Frangipanni, to
take care of the baby while they were gone, which she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Oswald drink at that party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That I do not recall. I know I drank quite a few
glasses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What impression did you have as to how the people at the party
reacted to Marina and to Oswald&mdash;take them separately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I did not pay any attention. I left them to their
own devices. I spoke to various people. I thought I had done my duty by
bringing them along. What really impressed me that particular night was
an extraordinary interest which developed between this Japanese girl, Yaeko&mdash;I
don't remember her last name&mdash;but I already had given that impression of
mine at the American Embassy so they could check on that. She was a Japanese
girl, very good looking, who worked, I think, at Neiman-Marcus in Dallas,
and was brought into Dallas from Japan by some people in the cotton business
to take care of their babies.</p>

<p>Now, this girl is a much superior girl as to be just a baby caretaker. She
eventually left that couple&mdash;that is all hearsay, you see, and became sort of
a girl friend of a Russian musician who lives in Dallas by the name of Lev
Aronson. And I do not recall whether he was at the party or not. But Yaeko
was, and they developed an immediate interest in each other&mdash;Oswald and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
Yaeko. They just went on sight and started talking and talking and talking.
I thought that was understandable because Oswald had been in Japan, you
see. But the interest was so overwhelming that Marina objected, and became
very jealous. She told us, either that night or later, that Oswald got her
telephone number, she noticed that Oswald got this girl's telephone number.
And once or twice later on she told us that she has the impression that Oswald
is carrying on something with this girl. Now, this is hearsay again. <span class="locked">But&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, it is not hearsay that Marina told you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; but hearsay that they are carrying something
on. That is what she told us. But nothing definite.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you notice any incidents in which&mdash;at that party&mdash;in which
<span class="locked">people&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. My wife will tell you more about this Yaeko incident,
because she knows a little bit better.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will make a note of that so I can talk to her about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. And she is more on the gossipy side. I'm always
happy if a girl likes a boy and a boy likes a girl&mdash;it does not matter who they
are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were there any incidents that you recall in which members at
that party were talking with Marina and Oswald interrupted?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I do not recall, because I did not speak to
them. I just left them alone, hoping that they would find some people to talk
to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the contacts you had with Marina and Lee, was there ever
any discussion on the subject of whether people in Russia when they were there
were chary about talking with Lee because they were afraid he might be an
agent of some kind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It is a question I have to try to think a little bit
about.</p>

<p>I have a vague recollection that either Lee or Marina did tell me the people
were afraid of him, and I think that was probably Oswald that told me, that
the people were afraid of him, like many foreigners. So I thought that was
very understandable, because you know the Communists are scared&mdash;not the
Communists, but the people in Russia are scared to talk to foreigners.</p>

<p>We had an incident ourselves when we went to Mexico, to a Russian exhibit,
to a Russian Fair, and tried to speak to an architect there in charge of the
architectural exhibit. This was a lady architect, a charming woman. We
spoke to her for about 5 minutes, and then she disappeared, and you could not
find her any more. She ran away from us. She was scared of us. That is
the usual thing.</p>

<p>So I did not pay particular attention to that fact. If people were scared of
talking to Oswald, it was understandable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did that ever arise, discussions as to why&mdash;possibly affecting his
desire to return to the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I do not recall that. The most important answer
I think I got from Oswald&mdash;and that was one of the reasons we liked him and
thought that he was rather intelligent in his estimation of Soviet Russia&mdash;is
the fact that we asked him, both my wife and I, "Why did you leave Soviet
Russia", and he said very sincerely, "Because I did not not find what I was
looking for."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you ask him what he was looking for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. A Utopia. I knew what he was looking for&mdash;Utopia.
And that does not exist any place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This man could not find what he was looking for anywhere in this
world.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He could not find it in the States, he could not find
it any place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He could find it only in him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Exactly. He could find it in himself, in a false image
of grandeur that he built in himself. But at the time that we knew him that
was not so obvious. Now you can see that, as a possible murderer of the President<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
of the United States, he must have been unbelievably egotistical, an unbelievably
egotistical person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know what paranoia is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I know it very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you <span class="locked">notice&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Because I am interested in medicine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you notice any tendencies&mdash;this may be rationalization, of
course, now that you are thinking back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I would call him a stage below definite paranoia,
which means a highly neurotic individual. But even an M.D. would not give
you a right definition, or a right demarcation between the two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any feeling, while you knew him, and before this
tragic event occurred, that there was any mental aberration of that nature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I did not know anything about his background, you
see. I did not know anything about his previous background, except that he
had been in the Marine Corps, that he came from a poor family, that he had lived
in New Orleans. That is all I knew about him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I wanted to ask you about that. Was your discussion with him
as to his background, let us say, if I may use a conclusion myself, superficial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Very superficial, because I was not&mdash;I know that type
of person, I know his background. I know the people in New Orleans. I lived
there. I know people in Texas of the very low category. I know the way they
live. I could see clearly what type of background he had. I did not have to
ask him questions. And he mentioned that while living in New Orleans, and
very poorly, he started going to the public library to read the Marxist books,
all by himself. That he was not induced by anybody. I said, "Who told you
to read the Marxist books"&mdash;that interested me. And he said, "Nobody, I went
by myself. I started studying it all by myself."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He read those high-level books, but in your opinion he did not
understand them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I would not understand them. I would not bother
reading them. I never read any Marxist books, because I know what they
contain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you could read them with a critical mind, could you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I could read with a critical mind. But that is
something that does not interest me. And I know that they are very difficult.
I know that they are written in a difficult manner, that they are highly theoretical,
and to me very boring.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There is some intimation that at this party Oswald had said several
times that he liked Russia and he might go back. Did you overhear any
of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And from all your contact with him, had he ever expressed that
notion to you, that he might go back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I do not recall exactly, but something comes to my
mind that he might have mentioned that, that if he does not get a better job,
or if he does not become successful, he might as well go back to Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, this was really something said in despair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. More or less&mdash;"After all, what is my life in Russia"&mdash;I
remember he said that, that his life in Russia was actually better than here.
But Marina never said that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She didn't?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember some people at that party by the name of
Mr. and Mrs. Daniel F. Sullivan of Lafayette, La., a divisional geologist for
Continental Oil Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any discussion at that party about the possibility that
Oswald might be a Russian agent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I never heard that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that this theory was thrown out because Oswald was broke,
and that it could not be that way, because Russia would not permit one of its
agents to be that penniless?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is an intelligent estimation, but I certainly have
not heard that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any discussion there or speculation that there was something
peculiar in the fact that allegedly they had had little trouble in getting Marina
out of Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That he had trouble getting her out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Relatively little.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is a question that always was sort of a big
question mark to me. Not being interested, I did not probe them. But it always
remained a question mark in my mind, how is it possible for somebody to take
a citizen of Soviet Russia so easily out of the country. But I have known of
other examples of it being done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any discussion at any time while you knew the Oswalds
about any attempt to commit suicide?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. When he was in Russia, no; I don't remember anything
about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever notice he had a scar on his left wrist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I didn't notice it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever note whether he was right or left handed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Something vaguely I remember that he might be left
handed but I could not recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is pure vagueness on your part?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Very, very. My wife may recall that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You wouldn't want to express any opinion one way or the other
on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever discuss with him his experiences in Russia with
respect to hunting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Never have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No discussions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Or the use of any weapons or his right to have
weapons when he was in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I did not know even that he was interested in weapons
'til the day&mdash;which probably you will ask me later on&mdash;Easter, I think, when my
wife saw his gun. I didn't know he was interested. I didn't know he had the
gun. I didn't know he was interested in shooting or hunting. I didn't know he
was a good shot or never had any impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now that you have mentioned that we might as well cover that
fully in the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me about that incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That incident is very clear in my mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was in 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In 1963, and the last time we saw them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was the last time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. The very last time we saw them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was around Eastertime?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Around Eastertime.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In April?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In April. It was in the second apartment that they
had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was on Neely Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. On Neely I think one block from the previous place
they used to live.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. And Jeanne told me that day, "Let's go and take a
rabbit for Oswald's baby."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was on Easter Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Easter day. I don't remember it was Easter Sunday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Easter is always on Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; maybe it was the day before, the day after, but
I think it was on the holiday. Maybe my wife will remember the date exactly.
And so we drove over quite late in the evening and walked up&mdash;I think they
were asleep. They were asleep and we knocked at the door and shouted, and
Lee Oswald came down undressed, half undressed you see, maybe in shorts,
and opened the door and we told him that we have the rabbit for the child.
And it was a very short visit, you know. We just gave the rabbit to the baby
and I was talking to Lee while Jeanne was talking to Marina about something
which is immaterial which I do not recall right now, and all of a <span class="locked">sudden&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. Mr. Reporter, Jeanne is spelled J-e-a-n-n-e.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. And I think Oswald and I were standing near the
window looking outside and I was asking him "How is your job" or "Are you
making any money? Are you happy," some question of that type. All of a
sudden Jeanne who was with Marina in the other room told me "Look, George,
they have a gun here." And Marina opened the closet and showed it to Jeanne,
a gun that belonged obviously to Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was a weapon? Did you go in and look?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I didn't look at the gun. I was still standing.
The closet was open. Jeanne was looking at it, at the gun, and I think she
asked Marina "what is that" you see. That was the sight on the gun. "What
is that? That looks like a telescopic sight." And Marina said "That crazy idiot
is target shooting all the time." So frankly I thought it was ridiculous to
shoot target shooting in Dallas, you see, right in town. I asked him "Why do
you do that?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He said "I go out and do target shooting. I like
target shooting." So out of the pure, really jokingly I told him "Are you then the
guy who took a pot shot at General Walker?" And he smiled to that, because just
a few days before there was an attempt at General Walker's life, and it was
very highly publicized in the papers, and I knew that Oswald disliked General
Walker, you see. So I took a chance and I asked him this question, you see,
and I can clearly see his face, you know.</p>

<p>He sort of shriveled, you see, when I asked this question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He became tense?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Became tense, you see, and didn't answer anything,
smiled, you know, made a sarcastic&mdash;not sarcastic, made a peculiar face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The expression on his face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right, changed the expression on his face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You saw that your remark to <span class="locked">him&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had an effect on him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Had an effect on him. But naturally he did not say
yes or no, but that was it. That is the whole incident. I remember after
we were leaving, Marina went in the garden and picked up a large bouquet
of roses for us. They have nice roses downstairs and gave us the roses to
thank for the gift of the rabbit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall an occasion when you came to their <span class="locked">home&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Excuse me, before I forget I wanted to insist on one
thing which I meant to tell you before that. What was the main thing that
I really liked about Oswald, you see. You asked me that question before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He was ferociously, maybe too much so, for integration,
advocate of integration. He said that it was hurting him, the fact
that the colored people did not have the same rights as the white ones, and this
is my opinion also, you see. I was very strongly opposed to segregation, and
I am sometimes very violent on that subject, because it hurts me that I live
in Texas you know and I do not have colored friends. I cannot afford to
have colored friends, you see. It annoys me. It hurts me. I am ashamed of
myself. And I try to make some friends among the colored people and the
situation is such that it is hard to keep their friendship in Texas, you know.
So I know what the situation is. On that point Oswald and I agreed. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
this is another reason why Oswald and Bouhe fought so bitterly, because
Bouhe is a segregationist. He is an old-guard segregationist that he learned
from the Texans you know that the colored man is just a flunky. And I had
quite a few fights with him about that, with Bouhe. And possibly his animosity,
Oswald's animosity to Bouhe and vice versa were based on that, you see,
although I am not so sure about it. But I assumed that that was one of the
reasons.</p>

<p>And I think that was a very sincere attitude on his behalf, very sincere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I would like to return to this gun, this weapon incident, the
Walker incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there ever an occasion after this time, when you and
Mrs. De Mohrenschildt came to see the Oswalds, that as soon as you opened
the door, you said, "Lee, how is it possible that you missed?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Never. I don't recall that incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have now given me your full recollection of that entire
rifle incident?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Weapon incident, and what you said to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, yes, yes, yes; that is right. How could I
have&mdash;my recollections are vague, of course, but how could I have said that
when I didn't know that he had a gun you see. I was standing there and then
Jeanne told us or Marina, you know, the incident just as I have described it,
that here is a gun, you see. I remember very distinctly saying, "Did you take
the potshot at General Walker?"</p>

<p>The same meaning you know, "Did you miss him," about the same meaning?
I didn't want him to shoot Walker. I don't go to that extent you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You didn't want him to shoot anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Anybody. I didn't want him to shoot anybody.
But if somebody has a gun with a telescopic lens you see, and knowing that
he hates the man, it is a logical assumption you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You knew at that time that he had a definite bitterness for
General Walker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I definitely knew that, either from some conversations
we had on General Walker, you know&mdash;this was the period of General
Walker's, you know, big showoff, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was quite militant wasn't he.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He was, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. De Mohrenschildt, up to that moment, is it your testimony
that you never knew and had no inkling whatsoever, that the Oswalds had a
rifle or other weapon in their home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Absolutely positive that personally I didn't know
a damn thing about it, positive, neither did my wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And as far as you know your wife didn't either?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see the weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I did not see the weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I won't show it to you then. Was there any discussion about
the weapon thereafter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No, no discussion. That ended the conversation,
the remark about Walker, ended the conversation. There was a silence after
that, and we changed the subject and left very soon afterwards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have a feeling that he was uncomfortable?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Very, very uncomfortable, but I still did not believe
that he did it, you see. It was frankly a stupid joke on my part. As the
time goes by it shows that sometimes it is not so stupid. But you know my
wife will tell you probably that I have a very stupid, bad sense of humor, she
says, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Some people say you have a sadistic sense of humor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Possibly. She says so also, my wife usually says
that I like to tease people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you do, don't you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She dislikes it. I like to, certainly, and I don't
mind if people tease me. I never get mad you know. It is perfectly all right
if somebody teases me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you a member of a group in Dallas known as the Bohemian
Club?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Oh, yes, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us about the Bohemian Club. Did you organize it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; Mr. Ballen and I organized it together and the
occasion arose one day when Mr. Ballen and I were driving back from a well, an
oil well we were driving far away from Dallas. It was a long drive and we were
discussing our lives in Dallas and a little bit exchange about the sort of boring
people we have around in Dallas you know, nothing but Texans. And then by
God, says Ballen, "We should do something about it. We should organize&mdash;there
are some interesting people in Dallas. We should organize a group for
free discussion. And also we should put&mdash;we all like to eat well. Let's combine
it with good eating." And that is how the idea originated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you called it what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. We called it the Bohemian Club, a little bit based on
the Bohemian Club in San Francisco. And we invited&mdash;we decided to invite
people who are sort of unusual and in different professions, and that no business
should be discussed during the meetings, that the member whose turn it is to
make a speech should also provide the dinner, and either cook it himself or
his wife would cook it or he should invite all of us to a restaurant of his choice.
This lasted I guess for a year or 2 years you know. We had quite a few meetings,
very interesting, controversial meetings, because the main point was that
you had to express yourself freely on the subject which is very important to
you. Then followed a discussion of all the other members.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the subject.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. On the subject.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it intended that the discussions be provocative or presented
in a provocative fashion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. As much as possible, and we had some real lulus
there, some very provocative discussions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there an occasion when you had this club at your home or
restaurant that you supplied the meal?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; one day I think I made one particular speech
that I made on the subject of Vlacsov's Army which are the White Russians
and refugees who decided to fight with the Germans against Soviet Russia.
They were helped by General Vlacsov who was a Soviet General, and then later
on became Commander, was made prisoner by the Germans and then decided
to fight the Communists, because obviously he was dissatisfied with the Stalinist
regime, and it was quite a large group. I never met any people of that type,
but Mr. Voshinin provided me the material on that subject, and I made this
little speech and I think everybody was very satisfied with the speech except
Lev Aronson who is a Jewish friend, a Jewish friend of mine who was in the
German concentration camp and he obviously had met some of those Vlacsov
soldiers, and anyway he criticized me quite a lot on that speech.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he criticize you during the course of the meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. During the course of the meal?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you accuse anybody of being a Nazi?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Did he accuse?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Did I accuse anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the way of provoking the discussion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Of provoking the discussion? I don't remember
that. Possibly I had, but I don't remember that. Actually he accused me
more or less of being pro-Nazi by giving that speech you see. He accused
me of being, which I am not you know, but that expresses my opinion of the
difficulty that sometimes the refugees are in when their opinions, political
opinions, differ with their own country you see. Those are the people who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
fighting their own country because they were deeply inside anti-communists,
you see. I didn't say that I was all for them you see. I just described this
as an interesting incident because I just read a book on that subject or something
you know, and I thought that it was an interesting incident of the last
war that occurred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever see Oswald operate an automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I had the impression that he didn't know how
to drive and I was quite <span class="locked">surprised&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What gave you the impression that he didn't know how to drive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I couldn't swear to that, but I think I asked him "Do
you know how to drive an automobile? Why don't you buy yourself an automobile?"
I remember saying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where would he get the money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, you know you can buy a car for $20, or $30,
some old wreck, and somebody with any mechanical ability could fix it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was his response to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I have the impression that he said that he didn't
know how to drive, but I couldn't swear to that. And naturally Marina was
needling him all the time to buy an automobile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, she was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; she was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have a definite impression?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. A definite impression of that. She was needling him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Apart from an impression, as a matter of fact you were present
and knew she was needling him to purchase an automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I could almost swear to that, but again it is so vague
I could not recall the exact words, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you do have a definite impression of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, I have a definite impression of that. I might
have put it in her mind you know. Either my wife or I might have put it in
her mind because it is incomprehensible to live in Texas without an automobile.
It is not like New York. They were completely isolated where they were living,
you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were suggesting it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I might have suggested it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Because of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Or my wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What impression, if you have any, do you have with respect to his
sexual habits? Did you ever have any thoughts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As to whether he was a homosexual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was not in your opinion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't think so, I think he was an asexual person,
asexual, and as I told you before, Marina was bitterly complaining about her
lack of satisfaction. This is really the time that we decided just to drop them
you see. One of the reasons you see we decided not to see them again, because
we both found it revolting, such a discussion of marital habits in front of relative
strangers as we were, see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this occurred more than once?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. You see this occurred probably in the first period
when we knew Oswald. You know there was a first period when we knew them,
until about October. Then we didn't see them any more, and I think it was
caused by many factors you know. We just got tired of them. We didn't like
them. We did not like this particular remark about sex life, and other things
you know. We just were not interested in them, and then the fact that she
returned back to Oswald, see what I mean, after we had taken her away from
him, that she went back to him that disgusted us.</p>

<p>We told her, "Now we helped you. We are not going to do anything more about
you." And we didn't see them in October, November, December, see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Except for this party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Except for the party, and then Christmas came and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
we thought well, the Oswalds all by themselves you know. It is Christmas time,
we should take them out. For that period they were completely out of my mind
you see. Then we decided to take them out, and I think it was in January after
this party that we took them again to meet Everett Glover.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will get to that in a moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think actually there were two parties that we took
them to. One at Ford's and the other at Everett Glover's. No, pardon me, I
made a mistake. We took them also, both of them one afternoon, and I think it
was still in the first period of us knowing them, to the house of Admiral Bruton
who is a friend of ours, and a retired U.S. Admiral who works in Dallas and has;
both he and his wife are good friends of ours. And they are very kind people.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bruton loves the children. She is a grandmother, and we told her that
here we have that miserable couple with a child, could we bring them to the
pool 1 day? And she said "fine, bring them along." And we brought them to
the pool, and no sooner the admiral saw Oswald you know, and heard a few
words from him, he said "take this guy away from me." This Bruton was quite
a hero in the war you know, and he immediately sensed that Oswald was a
revolutionary character you see, and no good. He sensed that, being a military
man you see. I think he asked him a few questions "is it true that you were
in the Marine Corps?" And Oswald made kind of a sour face about the Marine
Corps. So it was very short and very unpleasant interview because the admiral
left you know, and his wife, being a kind person, stayed there for a while you
know, and then we took the Oswalds back again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You never did use the pool?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. They never used the pool because I don't think Oswald
liked swimming. And just recently I got a letter from Mrs. Bruton in
Paris saying "is that the same man that you brought once to my house?" She has
been reading the story of Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you went over to pick up the Oswalds to take them to that
Christmas party did you enter their home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It is just vague to me. I don't remember how we
got them. Whether I did or my wife did&mdash;I do not recall how it was done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I was going to ask you whether you noticed if they had a Christmas
tree or any indication of celebration of Christmas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I have some vague recollection of some kind of
celebration but I do not recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever have any discussion with him as to whether he
did or didn't believe in Christmas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't remember. I assumed that he did not. Marina
was naturally interested in Christmas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did the Oswalds, either together or separately, come to your home
frequently or several times and spend the day with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I was trying to pin down how many times we saw
them in all, and it is very hard you know. I would say between 10 and 12 times,
maybe more. It is very hard to say.</p>

<p>Usually they were together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She come alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Sometimes she came alone; yes. I don't recall his
coming all by himself. I don't recall any incident.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There was some testimony to the effect&mdash;I want you to pause
before I ask you another question, exhaust your recollection on this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were there occasions when they came in the morning and stayed
all day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Marina might have stayed all day you see, or 3 or 4
hours you see. My wife will remember, will have a better recollection of that,
because I was at that time busy on three projects, and really my mind was on
something else, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Having exhausted your recollection, there is testimony to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
effect, about Marina, that "we used to come early in the morning, and leave at
night. We would spend the entire day with them. We went by bus."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. By bus? My wife will remember that better. Possibly
I was not at home you see. I was running around doing business, my
business you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You came to their home for short visits?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I came to their home for short visits, and sometimes
would find Marina alone, maybe twice, something like that you see, would find
Marina alone, and ask her, "How are you getting along? Goodbye."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever visit them and bring some foodstuffs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I do not recall that. My wife will remember that
better than I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does this refresh your recollection in any degree, testimony
that "the De Mohrenschildts visited us, they usually came for short visits. They
brought their own favorite vegetables such as cucumbers. George likes
cucumbers."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I like cucumbers, and I am sure that my wife
will remember that, because it was her idea, not mine. She was in charge of
food you know. If they did spend the whole day with us, it is possible it was
at the very beginning when my wife took Marina to the doctor, you know, and
then brought her back again, something like that. I don't remember seeing them
in the house all day long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But they might have been there all day long when you weren't
around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. They might have been, might have been. My wife
will remember that, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were there occasions when they had meals at your house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Oh, yes; I think so. I think so. I don't remember
the exact occasion but I am sure that we fed them quite often, because they
were hungry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As a matter of fact you went out of your way to see that they
were fed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, yes; I think so. My wife did, not I.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any discussion on your part with Oswald with respect
to his family, his mother, his brothers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; this is very interesting. I remember distinctly
that Marina especially told me that they had lived with the brother,
and that he told them to leave the house. Now we assumed that it <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Recapture your recollection a little more about this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It is something to that effect, you know, and it was
a little bit surprising to me, and then after seeing her for a little while, I
realized why they did, because she was incredibly lazy you see. She wouldn't
help anybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who was incredibly lazy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Marina, very lazy, wouldn't help anybody with anything.
When she stayed for instance with the Mellers, and the baby you see,
Mrs. Meller told us that she wouldn't help her at all, you know, around the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Would sit there and smoke and do nothing. Now
I have a recollection, a vague recollection of Lee telling me that he didn't get
along with his mother. Actually it was surprising how little he spoke about
his family. It was just something completely that was not discussed you know.</p>

<p>He didn't talk about it. But I have a vague recollection that he disliked his
mother. He didn't get along with his mother, and Marina disliked the mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Marina disliked the mother also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Marina disliked the mother also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have a definite recollection of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I have a recollection of some kind, not in any exact
words, but that is the impression I had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any discussion or did you become aware that they had
lived also with the mother as well as the brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I do not recall that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you have a definite recollection that Marina had met the
mother and had a reaction to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; Oh, that she met the mother, definitely. I
assumed that you knew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that reaction was an unfavorable one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Unfavorable reaction, and possibly my wife will
remember more than I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you get any reaction as to how Oswald felt with respect to
his brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Again a vague idea that he did not get along with his
brother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you become aware that he had two brothers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I didn't even know he had two brothers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any occasion when it came to your attention that
there was any alarm on Marina's part with respect to Lee possibly inflicting
some harm on Vice President Nixon, or former Vice President Nixon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That doesn't ring a bell at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It doesn't ring a bell at all. But what I wanted to
underline, that was always amazing to me, that as far as I am concerned he was
an admirer of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I was going to ask you about that.</p>

<p>Tell me the discussions you had in that connection. Did you have some discussions
with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Just occasional sentences, you know. I think once
I mentioned to him that I met Mrs. Kennedy when she was a child you know,
she was a very strong-willed child, very intelligent and very attractive child
you see, and a very attractive family, and I thought that Kennedy was doing a
very good job with regard to the racial problem, you know. We never discussed
anything else. And he also agreed with me, "Yes, yes, yes; I think it is
an excellent President, young, full of energy, full of good ideas."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he ever indicate any resentment of Mr. Kennedy's wealth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is definitely a point there, you know. He did
not indicate, but he hated wealth, period, you see. Lee Oswald hated wealth, and
I do not recall the exact words, but this is something that you could feel in
him, you see. And since he was very poor, you know, I could see why he did,
you see. I even would tell him sometimes, "That is ridiculous. Wealth doesn't
make happiness and you can be poor and be happy, you can be wealthy and be
very unhappy; it doesn't matter." I met a lot of wealthy people in my life
and found that quite a few of them are very unhappy and I have met quite a few
poor people and they are very happy. So it is nothing to be jealous of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever discuss with him Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Never discussed it with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he ever express any opinion with respect to Governor
Connally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Never had a word about it. You see, I was not
familiar with the fact that he did have a dishonorable discharge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is another subject.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were not familiar with that at all? It was never discussed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It was only in the papers that I read after the
assassination that I read in the papers that he had a dishonorable discharge.
I assumed that he had an honorable discharge. I assumed that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There was never any discussion in the Russian colony on the
subject that he had not had an honorable discharge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I do not recall that. I do not recall. But I was
again probing in my mind whether I heard anything about this dishonorable
discharge or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As you are sitting there, you are probing your mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, my mind, thinking about it, now you know, and
it is impossible to say because I read in the paper that he had a dishonorable
discharge, after the assassination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you don't want to rationalize?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I do not want to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now let us turn to the party at the Glovers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were acquainted with Mr. Glover, were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Everett Glover?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Everett Glover.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who is Everett Glover?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Everett Glover is a chemist at Magnolia Laboratories,
Standard Oil of New York Research Laboratories.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, had Everett Glover met the Oswalds prior to this party at
his home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He might have, I don't recall. He might have met
them, either Marina or both of them, for a short time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you exhausted your recollection on that subject?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. My wife may remember this more distinctly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But have you exhausted your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does this serve to refresh your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. Glover has stated that he had met Marina previously.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At your home several times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It could be; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It could be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It could be; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And had been invited to your home several times because she
was a Russian-speaking person who was having marital difficulties with Lee
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Very possible, very possible. Now I recall even this,
since you mention this. I suggested that they might live with Everett Glover,
this couple.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You made a suggestion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. To Glover. "You have an empty house. Why don't
you let them live with you and pay you so much per month?" And I think
he declined that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He did organize this party, however?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Who? Everett?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now he says it was on February 23, <span class="locked">19&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does that refresh your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I was placing it around January or February;
at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you attend that party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; as far as I remember, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Jeanne as well?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who else was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. At this party was a lot of friends of Everett Glover's
whose names I do not recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Volkmar Schmidt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, yes; definitely. We called him Messer Schmidt.
He is a German; very intelligent, young Ph. D. in sociology who also works at
the same laboratory as Everett Glover.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Magnolia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Magnolia Laboratory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was living with Glover at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Was living with Glover at the time, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He is a bachelor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. A bachelor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And who else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think we invited our neighbors, Mrs. Fox who
lived right next door to us, to that party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Fox?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is her first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Mary Fox.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is her husband's name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She is a widow, I think, but it might have been
a different party, but I have the impression that she was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Anybody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think we invited our landlord also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who is your landlord?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I forgot his name. Anyway he is my landlord. I
forgot his name. My wife has a better memory of names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Anybody else that you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. And Ruth Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Ruth Paine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you ever met Ruth Paine before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I think that was the first time we met Ruth
Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have never been in any singing groups with her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of which she was a member?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did engage in some singing groups, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; but a different type of singing. I was engaged
only in the church choir singing and I think she engaged in some sort of classical
music singing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Madrigal?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I beg your pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Madrigal?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Madrigal; that is right. There is a group in Dallas
to which Everett Glover belongs, you know, who I think spent some time
singing in the madrigal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you exhausted your recollection now as to everybody who
was present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. There were quite a lot of people there, but if you
mention the names I will say yes or no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I want you to exhaust your recollection first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I am not so sure. I think my daughter was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Alex?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Alex. I don't remember if Gary was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is her husband?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Her husband.</p>

<p>You see, we showed our movie quite a few times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you show it that night?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think we showed the movie that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were Mr. and Mrs. Norman Fredricksen present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That name is familiar to me but I couldn't identify
them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were these people interested in meeting the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think Oswald mentioned to me&mdash;Glover mentioned
to me that Mrs. Paine was a student of the Russian language, that she would
like to meet somebody with whom she could practice. That is my recollection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did the people engage in conversation with both of the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. They were surrounded by the whole group. I do
not recall what happened, because I was busy making the description of our
trip while the movie was being shown. That movie, by the way, did not interest
Oswald at all. He was not interested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The Mexican trip movie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; he was not interested. Neither Marina nor
Oswald were interested.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Neither one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why was that, do you think?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. They were not the outdoor-type people who would
appreciate that sort of thing, not sufficiently outdoor-type people, not sufficiently
sophisticated to appreciate that sort of a thing. At least that was my impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did any of these people inquire of Oswald as to his life in
Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think so. I think after the movie there was quite
an animated discussion there asking many questions and many answering. He
was there very happy you see, because he loved to be asked questions. He loved
to be the center of attention, and he definitely was the center of attention that
night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That night. What about Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, you know that she couldn't speak English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. There were people there who could speak Russian, weren't
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think she was talking mainly to Mrs. Paine, and I
noticed immediately that there was another nice relationship developed there
between Mrs. Paine and Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have some acquaintance with Mrs. Paine afterward;
you and Mrs. De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Never saw them again. Never saw them again as
far as I remember. That in my recollection was the only time I saw her. I
remember her distinctly because she is a very interesting and attractive person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember a Richard Pierce and a Miss Betty MacDonald
attending that party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I remember now Betty MacDonald. I don't
remember whether she was at the party but I think she was the librarian at
the Magnolia Research Laboratory.</p>

<p>Mr. Pierce is another friend of Everett's who also works at Magnolia, who
eventually became his roommate, or maybe he was already a roommate at the
time. I think he became a roommate later on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there anything that occurred at that meeting that you think
might be significant that you would like to tell us about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I really do not remember anything significant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you remain throughout the whole evening, or did you leave
before the party was over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I do not recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it you did not bring the Oswalds to that meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I do not recall either. I think they possibly have
come by themselves. Maybe somebody else brought them. Maybe, Everett
brought them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Either that or Everett?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; somebody else might have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was not your party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You assisted him, however, in arranging it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall anything said at that meeting with respect to their
eliciting from Oswald his views with respect to Russia, and in particular the
former government in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I remember quite a vivid discussion going on, you
know, because all those people are highly intelligent, and, very intellectual group<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
of people interested in what goes on in the world, and as far as I know none of
them has ever seen a Russian, and it was just like a new specimen of humanity,
you see, that appeared in front of them, both Marina and Oswald, an American
but who had been to Russia. But I don't remember any particular discussion
or disagreement or agreement. I think probably Oswald was talking most of
the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oswald was pretty proud, was he, of his ability to speak Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He was proud of it, yes; because it is quite an
achievement for a man with a poor scholastic background to have learned the
language. It is surprising to me. It was an extraordinary surprise for my
wife and myself that he was able to learn to speak it so well for such a short
time as he was supposed to have stayed in Russia. As I understand it, he stayed
there some 2 years, I gather.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. And it is amazing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In speaking of that, as I recall, you noted he had a conversational
command of the language.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But that he did not speak a refined Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No, no; not a refined Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He had trouble with his grammar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were there occasions when you knew them in which Marina
would correct his grammar and there would be an altercation between them or
something?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Oh, yes; there was bickering all the time. There
was bickering all the time. I don't remember whether it was especially on the
point of grammar, but there was bickering between them all the time.</p>

<p>But as I said before, the bickering was mainly because Marina smoked and
he didn't approve of it, that she liked to drink and he did not approve of it.
I think she liked to put the makeup on and he didn't let her use the makeup.
My wife will explain a little bit more in detail what was going on between
them, you see, because she was a confidante of Marina's, you see. I was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you elaborate, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, my wife being a woman was interested in
a woman's problems, you see, Marina's, in the baby and in her makeup, in the
way she dressed and the way she behaved, you see. She tried to correct her
manners, correct, teach her how to be a human being, you see, which Marina
did not know very well. She was doing her best to learn. She wanted to, but
she really had a very poor background, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You made a comment that you just said your wife had confidence
in Marina, but you didn't. What did you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Confidence from what point of view?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I mentioned that because I don't like a woman
who bitches at her husband all the time, and she did, you know. She annoyed
him. She bickered. She brought the worst out in him. And she told us
after they would get a fight, you know, that he was fighting also. She would
scratch him also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She would scratch him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She would scratch him also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall the time?</p>

<p>I will put the question this way in order to draw on your recollection, rather
than mine.</p>

<p>There was an occasion, was there not, that Marina left Lee by herself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Without being taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I have a recollection of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us about that. When did it occur?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't remember when it occurred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does October 1963 refresh your recollection?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Very possible, but that was the period when we
were very busy with our cystic fibrosis campaign.</p>

<p>I do recall that one day I was in Fort Worth and I decided to come to see Mrs.
Hall, with whom Marina was staying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you aware of the fact that Marina was at Mrs. Hall's?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you aware of how she had gotten there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I do not recall how it happened, but I was aware,
somebody told me that, that she was staying at Mrs. Hall's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The Halls were separated at that time, were they not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; and Mrs. Hall had the boy friend who was a
friend of mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. A long name, German name, but he was of Polish
extraction. He was in the plastic business. Now, his name, Doctor&mdash;he worked
for some plastic company in Fort Worth. Kleinlerer, Alex Kleinlerer. That
is the name.</p>

<p>Well, I had a very hard time finding the house where Mrs. Hall lived. I
think Mr. Clark told me. That is probably it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Max Clark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Max Clark probably told me that Marina is there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that 4760 Trail Lake Drive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; Trail Lake Drive. That is the place. And I
drove over and here was Marina, Mrs. Hall and Alex Kleinlerer. I don't
remember what we were talking about, what we discussed at that time. It
was a friendly visit to say how are you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What I was getting at, Mr. De Mohrenschildt, was that this
was an occasion when Marina had left her husband?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And come to the Halls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is, it is an occasion distinct from the one in which
you took Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Away from her husband. And this occasion we are now talking
about at the Halls occurred subsequently to the time that you had taken her
to the Mellers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. I think it was after our taking her away to
the Mellers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you arrived there, what did you discuss in respect to why
Marina was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I think I was discussing, I was talking to Alex
Kleinlerer and to Mrs. Hall.</p>

<p>Yes; something vaguely comes to my mind that Mrs. Hall was saying that
Marina should leave their place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Should leave the Halls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Should leave the Halls. The husband is coming back
or something like that, something to that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Her husband is returning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; something to that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did Marina leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That I do not recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't recall that she then went somewhere else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I do not recall. If you could refresh my memory I
may remember better. Again, I want to underline that all this is history for
me, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I appreciate that, and I must avoid trying to put things in your
mind also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which is what I am attempting to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right. As I remember, take Mrs. Hall&mdash;yes;
I remember what we were talking about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
Mrs. Hall had had an accident, and she had either a broken leg or a broken
arm, something like that, and she was in a cast. That is it. So we were talking
about the accident most of the time, you see, what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, that is a fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; she had an accident. I remember now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any discussion or do you have any opinion with
respect to Marina's religious belief, whether she had any, any religious feeling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I had a vague impression&mdash;I don't remember because
I do not discuss religion too often&mdash;that she had religious beliefs of some sort,
you see. She was a Greek Orthodox and did have some sort of religious belief.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What about Lee, on the other hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Lee, I think religion did not exist for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He didn't believe in God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. God, I don't know, because I didn't ask him a straight
forward question, but I know that he did not believe in any organized religion.
That is for sure. But he never was militantly against religion as far as I
remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you have no recollection of any discussions or any impression
on your part about Marina going back to Russia at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Something vaguely goes on in my head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oswald trying to get her to return to Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Something vaguely goes on in my mind, but I do not
recall. Very possible, you see, that something was mentioned like that. I
didn't pay any attention, in other words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Oswald express views with respect to individual liberty and
freedom of the press?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't think he understood the freedom of the press,
and individual liberties. I think he was too stupid to understand the advantages
we have of the free press and the free speech. Not too stupid, I mean, but too
uneducated to understand the great advantages we have in free press and free
discussion and in individual freedoms.</p>

<p>Like many native-born Americans, he did not appreciate the advantages you
get in this country, you see. You have to be a foreigner to appreciate it a little
bit more. Many Russians, all the Russian refugees appreciate that, you see,
but many who are born here don't appreciate it. Not all of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What about Marina and her politics?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Marina was definitely more appreciative of life in
the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was she inclined to discuss politics?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Not too much; no. That was Lee's main point, you
see, to discuss politics.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was her attitude toward Lee's views in that respect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She more or less considered him a crackpot, as far
as I remember, you see. A few times she said, "Oh, that crazy lunatic. Again
he is talking about politics."</p>

<p>This is one of the reasons we liked her, because that was a very intelligent
attitude, you see, but it was very annoying to Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was another source of annoyance between them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; there were so many sources of annoyance, as you
know, that it was just an unhappy marriage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have stated at one time Oswald gave you something to read
that he had written.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I don't remember at what particular time, but
he gave me to read his typewritten memoirs of his stay in Minsk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it in the form of a diary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, more or less the form of a diary, not day by
day, but just impressions. And as far as I remember, I read through these
typewritten pages, I don't remember how many of them there were, and made
comments on it, you see. But I don't think they were fit for publication.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were they political in nature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; not political in nature, but there was nothing
particularly interesting to an average person to read. It was just a description<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
of life in a factory in Minsk. Not terribly badly written, not particularly
well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Not good, not bad?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Not good, not bad. Nothing that I really remember
too well. I don't remember too well what was written there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will show the witness pages 220 through 244, Commission
Document No. 206. Would you glance through those pages and tell me if it
has the material he showed you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I don't remember seeing that beginning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Let's get over to the area in Minsk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; that is not at all familiar to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The witness is now looking at page 232.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Starting here at the bottom of page 232 it looks
familiar to me. How many mistakes he makes here, it is terrible. It does not
look familiar to me. I think it was something else that he showed me. I do
not recall that. That I definitely do not remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I would have remembered that sentence, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are now on page 235:</p>

<p>"I am having a light affair with Nell Korobka."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I would have remembered something like that, you
see. Again another sentence I do not recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. "My conquest of Anna Tachina, a girl from Riga."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Do you want me to glance through that? It does not
look like the same document.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If it is not the same <span class="locked">document&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I don't think it is the same document.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now I will have the witness look at pages 247 through 301. This
is a composition entitled "The Collective" and "Minsk, Russia," with a foreword,
an autobiographical sketch of Oswald.</p>

<p>I will direct your attention to some of these headings, "Description of Radio
Factory," "Quota Conditions," "Description of TV Shop," "Background of Shops,"
"Individual Workers," "Controls of Collectives," "Demonstrations in Meetings,"
"Factory Makeup," and "Peoples," "Layout of City of Minsk," "Tourist Permits
and Tourist Passports," "Collective Farms and Schools, Vacations."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I don't remember this document, but I think I
remember something, "Layout of City of Minsk," because that would have attracted
my attention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, let's find that spot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That looks familiar to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. First there is a heading, "About the Author." I call your attention
to a statement which says, "Exotic journeys on his part to Japan and
the Philippines and the scores of odd islands in the Pacific." Did he ever
discuss that with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was at Subic Bay in the Philippines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I don't remember him mentioning that to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now the witness is looking at part 1, which is on page 248.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; this looks slightly, vaguely familiar, starting
from page 248. That looks vaguely familiar. I am not going to read all this
because it looks very boring to me. I mean it is something that doesn't interest
me. It looks vaguely familiar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does it also refresh your recollection of discussions you had
with him before his life in Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That looks familiar to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This whole division?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. This whole division looks familiar to me. As I said
before, I did not look carefully when I originally saw this document, and I think
this is the same one, because it looks familiar to me.</p>

<p>I just glanced through. I realized that it is not fit for publication. You
can see it right away. Who is interested to read about comrade this and
comrade that, you see?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
But it is a factual, it seems like a factual report on his conditions of life of
a worker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is horrible grammar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Horrible grammar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And horrible spelling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But it could be reworked by somebody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Let's get to the next division here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Here is something that I remember we discussed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are now at page 262.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think here he talks about those meetings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That he did not like?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That he did not like.</p>

<p>Do I have to read that? Frankly, it is <span class="locked">very&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No; you don't. We are trying to find out whether this is the
paper he showed you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Here is something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I now direct your attention to page 269.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. This is something that is much more familiar to
me because I was interested in the town itself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this is the paragraph beginning, "The reconstruction of
Minsk is on an interesting story reflecting the courage of its builders."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; that was something that interested me because
I lived in my childhood in this town and I remembered some of the buildings.
I remember asking Oswald about what happened to this street and that
street, you see. But I forgot the names. I just described them. What happened
to this street and that street?</p>

<p>He gave me some sort of an answer that now it is full of big buildings, you
see, and I remember it as being full of small provincial houses, you see. And
again I cannot swear to the fact that that is the same paper I saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But this seems to you more familiar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. More familiar maybe because I paid more attention
to the city than I paid to something else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is quite a long diatribe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It couldn't be the same document because that
wasn't as long as that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I now exhibit to the witness a series of five untitled compositions
on political subjects appearing in the same exhibit I have already identified,
the first of which is at page 304.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. This is definitely not familiar to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And runs through page 309.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I am just glancing through but it doesn't look
familiar to me. Maybe I just didn't pay any attention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next commences on page 310 and runs through to page 312.
It is a short one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; that doesn't look familiar to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next commences at page 313 and concludes at page 315.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It does not look familiar to me. As I said before,
I have the impression that the pages he showed me were only about the city of
Minsk and the TV factory there, but not about his life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were they typewritten or in longhand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Typewritten.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The balance is on pages 318 through 329. Would you glance
through those, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Oh, that is definitely nothing that I have seen
before, because it has the name of General Walker in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you had not seen it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I had not seen it. Now, the publication, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
the publication, the document I saw was, as far as I remember, not political,
but a very simple account of his life in Minsk, and in the TV factory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think we had better call Mrs. De Mohrenschildt and tell <span class="locked">her&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That she is ready for action?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No; that we are going to run you well into the afternoon. I
have got a couple more pages of notes here. Maybe around 3:30 will be closer.</p>

<p>If you think it would be better to release her for the afternoon or find out
where she is going to be.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 12:55 p.m., the proceeding was recessed.)</p>

<hr />
<h2>TESTIMONY OF GEORGE S. DE MOHRENSCHILDT RESUMED</h2>

<p>The proceeding was reconvened at 2 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As I recall, yesterday you testified your recollection was that
early in your acquaintance with the Oswalds, you approached Sam Ballen to
see if he could undertake or might be able to employ Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To refresh your recollection in that regard, Mr. Ballen says his
recollection is that he first met Lee in December 1962 or January 1963 at your
home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It could be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he was aware that you had approached Mr. Ballen's wife and
other people to assist the Oswalds, and also to have them out socially.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did do that, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, I don't remember whether I asked the Ballens
to invite them, but I did ask some other people to invite them, because they were
so lonesome. And maybe fortunately for them, they refused.</p>

<p>I remember I asked a physicist to invite them in Dallas, and they just refused.
He said, "I don't know those people. I don't want to have anything to do with
them."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. His recollection is about 10 days after he met them at your
home, you called him and asked if he might be able to employ him, or might
be helpful in his obtaining a job.</p>

<p>Does that stimulate your recollection that the events you mentioned yesterday
occurred probably in December 1962 or January 1963&mdash;that is, the event
regarding your effort to induce Mr. Ballen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes&mdash;it should be probably at that time, because&mdash;I
had the impression that it was earlier than that&mdash;when he was moving from
Fort Worth to Dallas, at the very beginning. I still have the impression. Because
that is where I was interested, to help them, you see.</p>

<p>I did not know that he lost his job with the other company. I didn't know
that.</p>

<p>All this is later, after we had already gone.</p>

<p>So I have the impression that maybe he confused the time. It seems to me
that I asked him at the very beginning when I met the Oswalds, when he lost
his first job in Fort Worth and was trying to move to Dallas&mdash;that was the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He lost his job at Leslie Welding Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. I don't know the name of that company, but
it was some welding outfit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Sheetmetal work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall the period when Marina stayed at the Fords, in
November?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. When she stayed at the Fords?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That was the time when we took Marina and the
child away from Lee and put her in the house of Mellers, and then the Mellers
asked Mrs. Ford to take her. I think that was the time.</p>

<p>And then, later on, the Fords asked Mrs. Ray to take Marina. She moved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
from one place to another&mdash;three times, as far as I remember, she changed
domiciles.</p>

<p>And finally returned to Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You remember this event you related yesterday, when you took
Marina from the home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As having <span class="locked">occurred&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In September.</p>

<p>I have the impression it was in September. But it is, again, only a recollection,
because I remember that it was a very hot day&mdash;very sunny, hot day. So it
could be in October. And also in October we started working on this campaign,
cystic fibrosis campaign, and were very busy.</p>

<p>But it might have been in October.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Ford's recollection is that Marina was at her home&mdash;she
came there on November 11, and left on November 17.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It could be that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this is while Marina was separated temporarily from her
husband?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. Unless she had been twice at her home. I
think she was only once at her home. There were three homes&mdash;once at Mellers,
the Fords, and the third at the Rays, one after another, in succession.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, this is apparently part of that series of changes she made
when she left, herself&mdash;that is, this was not an occasion when you took her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I think that is the occasion we took her&mdash;we
took her to the Mellers, and then she moved from them by herself&mdash;that we had
no knowledge of. How she moved or who took her from one house to another,
I do not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have a recollection there were two periods&mdash;one period that
you are talking about when you took her from the home, and then another
period when she left the home, herself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That could be, very easily. But then it would fit
very well in my schedule&mdash;that would have been the second time&mdash;because, at
that time, we were not seeing the Oswalds. We were busy on something else,
Jeanne was working both in the store and at the foundation, I was preparing my
project, and we were very busy, and didn't see anybody, practically, and especially
the Oswalds.</p>

<p>October, November; I don't think we saw them at all in October, November,
December.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did I ask you about Betty MacDonald this morning, as to whether
she was at that February 1963 party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Oh, yes; I think that is the librarian. The name
MacDonald sounds familiar to me. Is she Pierce's fiance? That is how I
remember her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am just trying to get these two events. Marina recalls when
they lived on Elsbeth Street she had a dispute with Lee, and&mdash;about her Russian
friends, in which he said, "Well, if you like your friends so much, then go ahead
and live with them."</p>

<p>And she said that left her no choice, so she got in a cab and went over to
Anna Meller's house with the baby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Oh, that is how she described it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was there a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That was the second time? What month was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, we took her there. But maybe she went
there for the second time, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, she may have forgotten you took her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; maybe she forgot it. You know, we took
all the furniture also. I could not forget that&mdash;because my car was loaded.
You could practically feel the ground. I still have the same car in Haiti today.</p>

<p>We had a tremendous load in our car. It took us the whole day to load and
unload and carry them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, she voiced the opinion that&mdash;she said Lee liked you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I am sorry that he did, but, obviously he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She said because you were a strong person. She is expressing
her opinion now, of course. But he only liked you among all this group. He
disliked Bouhe, he disliked Anna Meller.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That I am surprised, because Bouhe is very&mdash;a
person that you can like or dislike immediately. As to Mrs. Meller, I am
surprised, because she is very kind and a nice person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, this is Lee Oswald. That could possibly arise out of
the fact that Anna Meller befriended her when she left the household.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I don't know what the reason was.</p>

<p>But you have confirmed the fact that he didn't care for the people in the
Russian colony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He did not have any friends, you see. Maybe he
identified me not as a Russian, because I have not much Russian blood in me
anyway. Maybe he identified me as some sort of an internationalist, American.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Maybe you are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I am trying to think of other friends that he had. I
cannot recall, myself, a friend of his, actually. I could not say that. He could
be my son in age, you see. He is just a kid for me, with whom I played around.
Sometimes I was curious to see what went on in his head.</p>

<p>But I certainly would not call myself a friend of his.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, that may well be.</p>

<p>But Marina, at least, expresses herself that way&mdash;that you "were the only
one who remained our friend."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She said we were the only <span class="locked">ones&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who remained their friends&mdash;the others sort of removed themselves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Sure, we left, you know. We were no friends,
nothing. We just were too busy to be with them&mdash;period.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am not talking about you. I am talking about the other
people now.</p>

<p>As you related this morning, they began to withdraw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; and we were too busy. We saw them&mdash;we
withdrew also to an extent&mdash;you see what I mean. We saw a lot of them at
the beginning, and then we stopped seeing them. Then we saw them again
for Christmas and invited them to another party, and that is all.</p>

<p>Then we saw them the last time for Easter.</p>

<p>I am not defending myself for having seen them. But that is a fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I appreciate that.</p>

<p>What was your impression as to whether this was a hospitable man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Who, Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oswald. Was he a man who was not very hospitable?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I would not say so. To us, he was always quite
hospitable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To you, I appreciate that. I am trying to find <span class="locked">out&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. About the others, I don't know, because I never saw
anybody else there in the house.</p>

<p>I don't know how he would receive the people. I think he responded by kindness
with kindness. He was responsive to kindness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there an impression among the people in this&mdash;we have
talked about, that they came to feel that he didn't care for them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Oh, yes, yes; he didn't care for them because&mdash;well,
let me put it this way.</p>

<p>He didn't care for them because they didn't care for him, and vice versa.</p>

<p>But you see most of the colony in Dallas is more emotionally involved in
Russian affairs than we are, because they are closer to them. All of them have
been relatively recently in Soviet Russia&mdash;while my wife has never been in
Soviet Russia in her life, and I was 5 or 6 when I left it. So to me it doesn't
mean very much.</p>

<p>I am curious, but it doesn't mean anything&mdash;it is too far removed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he ever express any views to you or give you the impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
that he thought these people who had left Russia were fools for having left
Russia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I don't think so. I don't remember that.</p>

<p>Possibly he told somebody else. But not in my presence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he express any view to you or did you get the impression that
these people in this colony or group, they only liked money, and everything was
measured by money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, naturally&mdash;he didn't tell that to me, but you
can guess that that would be his opinion, because he was jealous of them. I tried
to induce him a few times to get on to some money-making scheme. I said, "Why
don't you do something to make money?"</p>

<p>But, obviously, it wasn't interesting to him.</p>

<p>Would you like me to say what I told you about this Solidarist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. You were interested&mdash;you asked me if I belonged to
some political party, and I said no. This group of Russian refugees called themselves
solidarists. And Mr. and Mrs. Voshinin in Dallas belonged to that group
and tried to make me join it. Not being interested, I refused, but I read some of
their publications. And it is a pro-American group of Russian refugees who have
an economic doctrine of their own. And they seem to have some people working
in the Soviet Union for them, and all that sort of thing.</p>

<p>It is a pretty well-known political party that&mdash;their headquarters is in
Germany.</p>

<p>That is about all I know about them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But that group didn't interest you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No, no; nor any other group.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I notice in the papers at my disposal some participation on your
part in a foreign council discussion group in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I belonged to that group&mdash;I don't remember
during what period&mdash;and came quite often to the meetings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is the name of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. The Dallas Council of World Affairs. I met quite
a few people at the meetings. But they were open, public meetings, where international
affairs were discussed. I remember several of the Dallas real conservatives
called that Dallas council very leftist. But I never noticed anything in
particular.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were there people of substance that participated in that group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; very much so. Mr. Marcus was the president
of it. Mr. McGee was the president of it.</p>

<p>Mr. Mallon was president of that, and actually organized this group. Mr.
Mallon is chairman of the board of Dresser Industries. But they invited some
people to Dallas who are possibly socialists&mdash;I don't remember seeing anyone, but
I guess they might have invited them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you on any occasion to express a view or say to anybody in
Dallas among your friends that Oswald was an idealistic Marxist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I might have said that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That he had read and created some sort of a theory,
a Marxist theory, for himself.</p>

<p>In other words, he created a doctrine for himself, a Marxist doctrine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that what you meant by use of the word "Idealist"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; that it was an idea in his head that he had&mdash;not
in a very flattering way I meant that. That he was building up a doctrine in
his head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever say anything to anybody on the subject that Oswald
was opposed to the United States policy on Castro in Cuba?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That I think he mentioned to me a couple of times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I do not remember the exact wording, but he said
that he had admiration for Castro for opposing such a big power as the United
States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did the Voshinins ever ask you not to bring the Oswalds around
to their house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. They refused to see and to meet the Oswalds,
either one of them. And I was quite surprised, frankly, why they didn't, because
we all did and at first helped them&mdash;and they usually were very cooperative in
helping the other people. In this particular case, they completely refused and
looked sort of mysterious&mdash;why they didn't want to meet them.</p>

<p>I never asked any questions. But that is their privilege, not to see them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember the days you were in Abilene?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall having discussed politics there, in which you indicated,
whether in provocation or otherwise, some admiration for the Soviet
system of government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I don't remember saying anything like that.
It might have been misinterpreted. But I believe in peaceful coexistence.
I think we can all live together without blowing each other to hell&mdash;and many
other people believe that we couldn't do that. Probably the person with whom
I was discussing it believed in immediate atomic retaliation. So, naturally,
I told him what the hell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall having said that if this country is ever invaded
by Russia, you would have a very good chance of coming into a top position
with the Russians if they invaded the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I never said that. That is a purely Texas invention.
It must have been a real enemy of mine who said that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are intellectually opposed to the Communist system?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I am. I am not interested in it&mdash;period.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You wrote&mdash;I don't know whether it was after your 8 or 9 months
in Mexico, when you were enamoured of Lilia Larin, or whether it was on this
previous occasion&mdash;when you were at the University of Texas, had you written
or were you writing a manuscript entitled "Experiences of a Young Man in
Mexico"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, yes; but that is more or less a romantic dissertation,
a romantic book based on some of my experiences there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you relate some of your romantic experiences?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, is it absolutely necessary? I don't recall even
what I had written there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I just wanted the general nature of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't recall what it is. It is probably based on
the travel in Mexico with some girls&mdash;that is about all. That is what I would
write at that time and that age.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were interested in girls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever have any people refer to you as the Mad Russian?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is an unfortunate term they call me quite often.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mentioned somebody from Brazil that had the sobriquet
of King of Bananas. Was that the King of Orchids rather than the King of
Bananas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, maybe. But we called him the King of
Bananas. At least I called him that.</p>

<p>I remember his name now&mdash;I mentioned it to you. Dr. Decio de Paulo
Machado. I still&mdash;I think he is still in existence, because I asked about him
recently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If I said you were an extrovert, would that agree with your own
judgment of yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I don't know if it is for others to call me.
I would rather be an extrovert than an introvert.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, for example, I regard myself as an extrovert.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Then I am happy to be an extrovert. I don't like
to be accused of being too much of an extrovert, because I think if you pass
the limit it is too much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of course. Any extreme is bad. I made a reference yesterday to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
Professor Zitkoff, in Houston. I thought that might stimulate your recollection.
Did you make regular trips to Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; quite often.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were they substantially regular&mdash;once a month?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No, no. Without regularity, but quite often&mdash;mainly
to see my clients there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your clients were who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In the oil business&mdash;I mainly used to come to see my
friend John Jacobs, vice president of Texas Eastern, and the social acquaintances
that I had there&mdash;Andy Todd, an architect there, a professor at Rice Institute.
And maybe somebody else&mdash;I don't recall the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But these trips to Houston were strictly business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. Maybe I was trying at the time to push forward
my project in Haiti, you see, whereby I was trying to raise some money for the
development of small industries in Haiti. And on that occasion I saw quite
a few important people. But purely for that purpose&mdash;purely for business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Is your daughter, Alexandra, a painter or an artist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; my wife's daughter is a painter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Christiana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there a time when both Christiana and your daughter were
living in Dallas with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, indeed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In your 1957 venture with the International Cooperation&mdash;as
an agent of the International Cooperation Administration, in addition to Poland,
as I understand it, you visited France?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Switzerland?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No. Sweden and Denmark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. France, Sweden and Denmark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you in mind, or did you hope during that period, that you
would also visit Switzerland, England, Italy, and West Germany?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; but I didn't see those countries&mdash;I didn't have
time to see them. Instead of that, I stayed much longer in Sweden, visiting
some distant relatives there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any political discussions with any so-called true
Communists when you were in Yugoslavia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Political discussions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Arguments?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Arguments; yes. Discussions, occasionally. The
real argument I had&mdash;I think maybe I mentioned it yesterday&mdash;was with the
head of the Communist Party in Slovenia, who attacked me very strongly for
being an American and for the fact that we had this Arkansas case, with
Governor Faubus. He was very obnoxious, and I told him that he reminded me
of an ultraconservative in the United States&mdash;they were both of the same type,
very illogical and very biased in their opinions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Biased and rigid?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; but I think in my stay in Yugoslavia, and
without taking too much pride in it, I made more friends for the United States
than anybody else, because they could&mdash;I could explain to them the opportunities
given to foreign born in the United States, and how joyful the life is in the
States. For instance, I used to explain to them how an independent can drill
an oil well with no money. To them it was beyond comprehension. To them it
was a miracle that a man like me was able to promote enough money to drill
an oil well. For them, it needed endless bureaucracy and enormous amount of
papers and all that, and finally the well was drilled, and at an enormous price&mdash;when
it could have been done very cheaply by purely organizing a small syndicate.
And since I had small production of my own, I explained to them how I
did that. And it was a fascinating story for them. So I think I did a good
job and made a lot of friends, who used to write to me from there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you make a trip to Europe in 1960? At that time, did you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
plan to leave early in March, March 11, and visit France, Yugoslavia, Italy,
England, and Belgium, for a period of 3 weeks, on geological visits?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. There might have been some projects to do that,
and it did not materialize.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Maybe this will stimulate you. You, at that time, were at the
Statler Hilton Hotel in Washington, D.C.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In 1960?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. March 10, as a matter of fact. Do you remember your passport
being renewed on March 11?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Did I go to Europe or not? I don't remember.
Maybe I went to Ghana at that time, in 1960 instead of going to Belgium&mdash;I
went on this consulting job to Ghana.</p>

<p>I don't recall. My wife will recall all that precisely, because she remembers
the dates.</p>

<p>I did go to Europe in 1960, because I remember I went to see my little boy in
Philadelphia at that time before going to Europe. I was planning to. But
my wife will remember all that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So we can identify you as far as these papers are concerned, is
this a fair description of you? That you are a white male, 6'1" tall, brown hair&mdash;dark
brown hair, blue eyes&mdash;do you have a scar on your face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. This scar is an old scar on the right-hand side, I think
you can see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Right-hand cheek?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. On the cheek&mdash;it comes from a dog bite in my childhood.
And this one is a new one&mdash;I got it in Yugoslavia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is about the center of your forehead, up top, near your
hairline?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You suffered that in Yugoslavia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I fell down on a rock with my head&mdash;had a few
stitches taken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And <span class="locked">your&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. By the way, I may say&mdash;my wife reminded me of it
today&mdash;regarding the fact that I was taking sketches of so-called Coast Guard
in Texas, in 1940 or 1941&mdash;of course, which I was not doing, because I was
sketching the beach. The same thing happened to me in Yugoslavia, except
that this time they were the Communists who thought I was making sketches
of their fortifications. Actually, I was also making drawings of the seashore.
And this time they shot at us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Shot. And they told me to get away&mdash;we were in a
little boat. And they kept on shooting at me. And the bullets were hitting the
water right around us&mdash;until we were away out into the sea. So I made a
complaint to the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade, and some kind of an investigation
was made. But this is an interesting correlation&mdash;that I am accused both by the
Yugoslavs and here, also, making sketches. I should abandon making sketches
in the future. No more painting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have a ruddy complexion, but also you have a dark skin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that a pigmentation, or from being out in the sun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I spend a lot of time in the sun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your brother Dimitri is a naturalized American citizen, is he not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; much earlier than myself, because I think he
came to this country in the early twenties.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The records show he was naturalized November 22, 1926, in
the U.S. district court at New Haven, which is where Yale University is located.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. He went to school at that time, to Yale.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do those facts square with your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; approximately the right period. I remember
he went to Yale with Rudy Vallee&mdash;they were roommates.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mentioned that your brother came over to Europe and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
was in Belgium while you were still there, just before you came back to this
country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No, no; before I came back for the first time to this
country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. Because it is my brother who helped me to
arrange my passport and my entrance. He didn't help me financially, but
arranged my permit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To refresh your recollection, the passport records indicate that
your brother applied for a passport for a visit in 1936, to visit Poland and
France for 3 months, and for the purpose of visiting his family, and collecting
material for magazine articles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does that square with your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is about the right time when I first saw him
after many, many years&mdash;we took a trip together to see our father in Poland.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, at that time, he had already completed his work at Yale,
had he not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He obtained his degree at Yale in 1926?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. I don't know what year he completed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he take some <span class="locked">additional&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. He took a Ph. D. at Columbia. But I don't
know what year he received his Ph. D.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I would suggest to you it was 1927.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Ph. D. at Columbia? I don't know the year exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your brother travels relatively frequently, does he not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; he travels whenever he had&mdash;whenever he can
get away from teaching.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he is a Ph. D. and a professor at Dartmouth College?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He is a full professor at Dartmouth College.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Hanover, N.H.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right. He also is editor of the Russian
Review, a magazine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Didn't he found that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; he founded that magazine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what does he teach at Dartmouth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think he is a professor of Russian culture, Russian
civilization, history.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall&mdash;is this a description of him: He is a white
male, 5 foot 11 inches tall, gray hair, brown eyes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; very strong brown eyes, very dark brown
eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Unlike yours, that are blue?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. He is browneyed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see your brother when he visited Europe in 1957?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; an amazing thing happened. You know, he
didn't know that we were in Europe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Neither knew that the other was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Neither knew. And we bumped into each other in
the most crowded street in Paris. It is an amazing coincidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does your brother have a mustache?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He used to. I don't think he has now. He may
have grown it lately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your daughter Alexandra has another given name, hasn't she&mdash;Romeyn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. That is a family name of the Piersons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was born April 17&mdash;December 25, 1943. We brought that
out yesterday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Christmas Day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever know your wife Phyllis' parents, Simone
Fleischer&mdash;Simone Fleischer Washington and Jack Stecker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I didn't know her real father. But I met her
stepfather&mdash;Walter Washington Stecker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was the daughter of Simone Fleischer, and was adopted by
Walter Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any contact with the Dominican Embassy in 1958?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In 1958, Dominican Embassy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The month of April.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. I think I was invited to&mdash;Dominican Embassy.
Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Here in Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. I was trying to work up some kind of concession,
I think. I was working on some kind of oil deal, and tried to contact
the Dominican Ambassador&mdash;purely for business reasons&mdash;some kind of an
oil project which had to do with the Dominican Republic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Have you been in the Dominican Republic in the
last&mdash;let's say the last 6 months?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I was there several times. No. 1, in March 1963,
on my way to Haiti, to sign a contract with the Haitian Government, but spent
only one night at the hotel there, between planes. It was necessary to stop
there, because there was no right connection. Pan American arranged so
that the passengers to Haiti would stop in the Dominican Republic for the
night, and then leave the next morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that the first time you were ever in the Dominican Republic?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is the first time I have ever been there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When next were you there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. The next time we were with&mdash;let's see&mdash;yes; we
were&mdash;my wife and I when we were coming to Haiti, exactly on the same&mdash;in
the same&mdash;the same occasion, to spend the night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just spent overnight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Overnight, and take the plane the next morning,
on our way to Haiti in June&mdash;I think the first or second of June in 1963. And
then just recently, about a week ago, when I went to check on some mining
possibilities, and get some information from the Bureau of Mines in the
Dominican Republic. And again I went to San Juan, and then picked up
my wife, and then brought her back into the Dominican Republic, finished
getting the information, and returned to Haiti. And then again on the way
to the United States now, just stopping there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On this present trip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; just stopping for 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Those have been your sole contacts in the Dominican Republic?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; to the best of my memory&mdash;yes; I remember
now why I tried to contact the Dominican Embassy in 1957. Somebody told
me&mdash;I don't remember who&mdash;that they needed a consulting geologist in the
Dominican Republic, and I tried to contact the ambassador, and never was
able to see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall commenting, along with Mrs. De Mohrenschildt,
that you know of no connection that did or could have existed between Lee
Oswald and any organization or government because you thought nobody
could stand him, and that you questioned his mental stability?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right. I remember making that statement.
I think it was in Port au Prince that I made that statement.</p>

<p>Naturally anybody&mdash;who would&mdash;in our opinion, if he killed the President
of the United States, he must have been mentally unstable. I could not find
any other explanation. Or somebody might have paid him for it. But this
is another speculation that came to me later on. But, again, it is purely
speculation on our part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, you had no&mdash;now that you have made that statement, I
have to pursue it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. By reading the papers, you know&mdash;we had no other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
information. By reading the papers and putting two and two together we
started wondering, maybe there is something behind it, you see&mdash;especially I
remember reading in one of the papers <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which papers are these&mdash;foreign language papers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; American papers. We haven't read any foreign
language papers. We get the Miami Herald, New York Times, we get
Haitian papers, French language papers, of course. And I think in one of
those papers it was said that Lee Oswald mentioned to his wife before the
assassination that he was going to get some money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So when you read that <span class="locked">article&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. When I read that article, then the idea started
coming&mdash;arising in my imagination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Assuming the article was correct, that Oswald had said to
Marina that he was going to get some money from some source?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you knew of no such thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you had no hint of it while you knew the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; when we knew the Oswalds, they were always
in dismal poverty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you visited Dallas at the end of May 1963, before you
went to Haiti, did you see the Oswalds then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I don't think so. My wife will tell you exactly.
I don't think we had time to see anybody. We were just packing.
As I recall it, I did receive a card, a postcard, from Oswald&mdash;I don't remember
when&mdash;before we left the United States, saying, "We are in New Orleans,"
and giving the address. And I lost that card.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you write a letter to Mrs. Hugh D. Auchincloss in December
of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I don't remember the date, but I did write
a letter to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. From Haiti.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You expressed your sympathy to her with respect to the death
of her son-in-law, John Fitzgerald Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall making this statement in the letter: "Since we
lived in Dallas permanently last year and before, we had the misfortune
to have met Oswald, and especially his wife Marina, sometime last fall."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What do you mean by the misfortune to have met Oswald and
especially his wife Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, now, since all this happened, it causes&mdash;it
is not pleasant to have known the possible assassin of the President of the
United States. And since he is dead, it doesn't matter. But we still know
Marina. We had the misfortune of knowing her&mdash;it caused us no end of
difficulty, from every point of view.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is what you meant by misfortune?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; and misfortune&mdash;also now, when you look
the situation over, it was just a misfortune that we helped them, that is all.
We shouldn't have done it. We should have known better. And, <span class="locked">actually,&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why should you have known better, Mr. De Mohrenschildt?
What was wrong with what you did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Nothing wrong. But it is wrong that we were
charitable to a person who turned out to be an assassin, maybe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you wouldn't have been charitable if you had any notion
he might have been. So what you did was a spontaneous, normal thing of an
outgoing person who wanted to help somebody. Is that a fair statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; it is correct. But still I regret that I have
known him. I shouldn't have been so extroverted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall saying in your letter, "Both my wife and I tried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
help poor Marina, who could not speak any English, was mistreated by her husband.
She and the baby were malnourished and sickly."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is all correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you told me all about that in some detail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You also said, if you will recall&mdash;"some time last fall we heard
that Oswald had beaten his wife cruelly, so we drove to their miserable place
and forcibly took Marina and the child away from the character."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have told me about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. "Then he threatened me and my wife, but I did not take him
seriously."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is exactly right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. "Marina stayed with a family of some childless Russian refugees
for awhile, keeping her baby, but finally decided to return to her husband." You
have told me about that course of events.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is what you had in mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is exactly right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then you comment, "It is really a shame that such crimes occur
in our times and in our country, but there is so much jealousy for success, and
the late President was successful in so many domains, and there is so much
desire for publicity on the part of all shady characters, that assassinations are
bound to occur. Better precautions should have been taken." Now, let me ask
you about the first two sentences.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In my opinion, if Lee Oswald did kill the President,
this might be the reason for it, that he was insanely jealous of an extraordinarily
successful man, who was young, attractive, had a beautiful wife, had all the
money in the world, and was a world figure. And poor Oswald was just the opposite.
He had nothing. He had a bitchy wife, had no money, was a miserable
failure in everything he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, do you have a view, perhaps, that this might be a way of
this man&mdash;of what he thought of raising himself up by his own bootstraps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Exactly. It made him a hero in his own mind&mdash;it
made him a hero in his own mind. He did not realize possibly that he was
doing it at the expense to the whole Nation. He might have had a mental
blackout.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then you make the comment "better precautions should have
been taken."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is my very strong opinion, that better precautions
should he taken by whatever authorities were in Dallas at the time to
protect the President.</p>

<p>Now, I do not consider myself an exceedingly&mdash;a genius. But the very first
thought after we heard that some character was mixed up in the assassination of
the President, when we were listening to the radio in the house of an employee
of the American Embassy in Port au Prince, and he mentioned that the name
of the presumable assassin is something Lee, Lee, Lee&mdash;and I said, "Could it be
Lee Oswald?"</p>

<p>And he said, "I guess that is the name."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That occurred to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That occurred to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As soon as you heard the name Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. As soon as I heard the name Lee. Now, why it
occurred to me&mdash;because he was a crazy lunatic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you think about the rifle you had seen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Immediately something occurred in my mind&mdash;the
rifle. Actually, my wife and I were driving from a reception at the Syrian Embassy,
where we heard the story of the assassination. We were driving to the
house of this friend of ours who works at the Embassy and wondering who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
could it be. And as soon as we heard that name, some association started working
in our minds&mdash;and the fact that there was a gun there.</p>

<p>But my opinion&mdash;and again&mdash;was influenced naturally by what you read and
hear in the papers. We were out of contact with people in Dallas, and out of
contact with events.</p>

<p>The only thing we could judge is what we read in the papers.</p>

<p>Sometimes you read something like he was going to get some money, and
naturally you start thinking that possibly somebody bought him.</p>

<p>Now, we heard, also, that he was getting some regular checks from somewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where did you hear that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That I read in the papers some place&mdash;he was getting
regular checks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That didn't score with your recollection, did it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I just read that in the papers some place.</p>

<p>Then you read this and that, I am not a detective. It is not up to me to make
any conclusions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This letter was written, I take it&mdash;it is dated December 12,
1963. At the time you wrote it you had some of these newspaper articles in
mind that were affecting your opinion, were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; but it contains all the <span class="locked">facts&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. Have you looked at the original of that letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, it looks to me that this is the original.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is your signature on the letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You will note it is dated December 12, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. December 12, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you look at the envelope that is attached to the letter.
Is that envelope addressed in your handwriting, or does it have any of your
handwriting on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; it is printed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Typed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Typed, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is that the envelope in which you dispatched that letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; it looks like that envelope.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is the date of the stamp cancellation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. December 13, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Port-au-Prince, Haiti. It was sent from Haiti, this
letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; that is your letter, and you dispatched it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you say in that letter, after expressing your sympathies to
Mrs. Auchincloss, and your very kind comments about Mrs. Kennedy, "I do hope
that Marina and her children (I understand she has two now) will not suffer
too badly throughout their lives, and that the stigma will not affect the innocent
children. Somehow, I still have a lingering doubt, notwithstanding
all the evidence, of Oswald's guilt."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, please explain that remark in that letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Unless the man is guilty, I will not be his judge&mdash;unless
he is proven to be guilty by the court, I will not be his judge, and there
will be always a doubt in my mind, and throughout my testimony I explained
sufficiently why I have those doubts. And mainly because he did not have any
permanent animosity for President Kennedy. That is why I have the doubts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that expression in this letter is based on all the things
you have told me about in this long examination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A natural, I would assume, view on the part of any humanitarian
person&mdash;that you just cannot imagine anybody murdering anybody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he in turn had been murdered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And his trial would never take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And on the basis of what little you knew, you had lingering
doubts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Not because you felt that anybody else might have been involved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you had no notion of anybody else, and no information of
anybody else being involved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I want to give you an opportunity to explain that fully.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I have no information whatsoever, except what
you hear now living in Port-au-Prince from the foreigners who read foreign
papers. And, of course, they are all of the opinion that Oswald did not kill
the President, that there was a plot, that there was&mdash;that somebody else was
standing on the bridge, there was a car there on the bridge from where they
were shooting, that there were four shots&mdash;and all those things are discussed
all day long in Haiti right now, in the colony of foreigners&mdash;Embassy people
and businessmen who live in Haiti, most of them Europeans, of course. They
discuss it all day long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And they are confining their judgment to what they read in the
papers they receive from their homeland?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Purely; yes&mdash;purely. As you know, there are sensational
articles being published right now in Europe on that subject.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. De Mohrenschildt, you know of no supposed facts that you
have read in these foreign language newspapers, do you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Do I know what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't know if there is any merit one way or another?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I don't know of any merit one way or the other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this remark of yours in the letter to Mrs. Auchincloss was
not intended to imply that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No, no; it was not. It was purely based on whatever
was expressed in my testimony. And I think it will be fair to say that I
will have that lingering doubt for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You may have an opportunity to read the Commission report,
which I assume you will.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I wish you the best of luck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You wrote Mrs. Auchincloss again, did you not, in February 2,
1964?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I hand you the envelope and letter. Do you identify those as
being the letter you sent to her and the envelope in which the letter was enclosed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; it is exactly the letter I have written.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This letter leads me then into your Haiti venture. Tell us about
it. How did that arise, when did you first think about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I started doing geological work in Haiti in 1956,
I think, the first time, where I worked for some Haitian people connected with
the Sinclair interests in Haiti.</p>

<p>I worked up a geological prospect for oil and gas drilling in the northern part
of Haiti, and we were able to sell the projects to a company in Tulsa, and finally
the deal fell through because of the Cuban situation.</p>

<p>In other words, the company did not want to drill in Haiti because of the
expropriations going on in the Caribbean area. And the next time then I was
in Haiti, as I explained before, after our <span class="locked">trip&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is the trip you made down there, Mexico and the Central
American countries?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes&mdash;in 1961&mdash;and started preparing this project from
then on.</p>

<p>Finally the project came to fruition in March 1963, and we left for Haiti&mdash;at
the end of May 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You made a trip to New York City before you went to Haiti, did
you not?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The first part of May 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About 2 weeks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; New York, Philadelphia, Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Visited your daughter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Visited my daughter. And also was in Washington
preparing for the eventuality of this project, checking with the people, Bureau of
Mines, and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there a gentleman by the name of Tardieu whom you were
attempting to interest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No, no; he is actually interested, and he is a Frenchman
living in Haiti, who was instrumental to an extent in getting this contract.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I hand you a document which we will mark "De Mohrenschildt
Exhibit No. 1."</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked "De Mohrenschildt Exhibit No. 1" for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It appears to be a piece of promotional literature issued in connection
with the Haiti venture.</p>

<p>Am I correct about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you send that to Mr. Raigorodsky?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, the upper portion is in French. Would you favor me by
reading first that which is on the left, and then that which is on the right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is a very long article. A magnificent success
for the Commercial Bank of Haiti. The result of a <span class="locked">trip&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is a headline?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Headline.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Shall I make a short resume of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I would prefer&mdash;can you translate that literally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. "The recent trip to the United States of America by
Mr. Clemard Joseph Charles, the active president and manager general of the
bank, Commercial Bank of Haiti, has constituted a magnificent success for this
banking establishment which is prospering right now.</p>

<p>"In reality, during one of the most amicable ceremonies, the assistant mayor
of New York, Mr. James O'Brien, has given to Mr. Clemard Joseph Charles the
keys of the city of New York in the name of Mayor Wagner, who was at that
time in Europe.</p>

<p>"The dinners and lunches have been offered in honor of Mr. Clemard Charles,
namely, by the American Express, Patent Resources, Inc., and the Hanover Trust
Co. A short contact with Mr. Clemard Joseph Charles has permitted us to
obtain certain information for the readers. The active president and director
general of the Commercial Bank of Haiti has been able to conclude an important
contract with one of the largest financial companies in New York which does
business in the millions of dollars. This enterprise guaranteed by the Import-Export
Bank, the Chase Manhattan Bank, and the Bank of America, will make
possible to the Haitian importers of American merchandise through the Commercial
Bank of Haiti the credits of unlimited amounts for 6 months and longer
periods.</p>

<p>"One other financial society which specialized in the real estate business which
does business for some $150 million per year, will start through the intermediary
of the Commercial Bank of Haiti a program of construction of houses whereby
the credit will be given for 10 years.</p>

<p>"A system of insurance will cover the construction and a house will be given as
a reward for the clients of the enterprise. Our country will be benefited with
important advantages because of the interesting contracts taken by Mr. Clemard
J. Charles in New York. The president and the director general of the bank
will take soon the plane for Canada and Mexico in order to follow on these important
contracts which will be very favorable to our economy, and will permit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
the Commercial Bank of Haiti to be of further advantage to the people of
Haiti."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have read the two columns appearing under that heading
that you described.</p>

<p>Now, would you read the column to the right of those two columns?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. "Mr. C. J. Charles, honorary citizen of the city of
New York. Mr. Clemard Joseph Charles, president and director of the Bank
Commercial of Haiti, Port-au-Prince, has come back yesterday morning with
his charming wife, Sophie, from a trip of 2 weeks in New York, and was accompanied
by Mr. James R. Green, vice president of the Manufacturers Hanover
Trust Co., which is a large bank of Wall Street, New York.</p>

<p>"Mr. Green spent just a few hours in the capital, just sufficient time to visit
the Commercial Bank with which Hanover Trust Co. wants to do business. Mr.
Charles is very satisfied from the contacts which he has made during this trip,
and satisfied with the promotion of his commercial bank. The Haitian banker
was honored by Mayor Wagner of the city of New York, and has made his
assistant, Mr. O'Brien, give the key of the city as an honorary citizen, to Mr.
Charles."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Reporter, would you mark that "George S. De Mohrenschildt
Exhibit No. 1"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. This is by the way the photograph of a paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is a photostat of two news items in the Haitian paper in
Port-au-Prince, together with a telegram.</p>

<p>Now, all those together comprised, did they, some of the promotion literature
with respect to your Haitian venture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In what respect? Can you give us the thrust of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In the respect that they acquaint the possible investor
with the personalities involved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Who is the gentleman who sent the telegram?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Mr. Tardieu.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is his first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Mr. B. Juindine Tardieu, who is the agent and you
might say a broker who negotiated the contract with the Haitian Government.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He is domiciled in Haiti.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, you had some correspondence with Clemard
Joseph Charles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is the letter I now hand you, which we will identify as George
S. De Mohrenschildt Exhibit No. 2, a photostatic copy of correspondence between
you and that gentleman, a copy of which you transmitted to Paul Raigorodsky?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; that is the letter I received.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked "George S. De Mohrenschildt Exhibit
No. 2" for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now I will show you a series of three documents, the first sheet
consisting of a photostat of an envelope addressed, I believe in your handwriting,
to Mr. Paul Raigorodsky; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In Dallas.</p>

<p>The next being a personal note of yours in your longhand to Mr. Raigorodsky;
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, indeed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next being in the form of a copy of a letter from you, dated
July 27, 1962, to Mr. Jean de Menil.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In which you have written in the upper right-hand corner in
your handwriting, "Copy for Mr. Raigorodsky."</p>

<p>Is what I have said correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And lastly, there appears to be promotional literature, one sheet,
dated August 1, 1962, signed by you at the bottom?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, indeed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And on your letterhead&mdash;George De Mohrenschildt, Petroleum
Geologist and Engineer, 1639-40 Republican National Bank Building, Dallas 1,
Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Reporter, would you mark those in the record, I have given
them to you, as "De Mohrenschildt Exhibits 3, 4, 5, and 6."</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked "De Mohrenschildt Exhibits 3, 4, 5,
and 6" for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In addition to those materials, did you also transmit to Mr.
Raigorodsky two additional documents which I have in my hand&mdash;one a photostatic
copy of a Western Union telegram, dated August 3, 1963, from Tardieu
to you, and the second document a copy of a letter of yours to the gentlemen I
mentioned a moment ago, Mr. Jean de Menil; dated August 7, 1962, upon which
there appears some handwritten notes of yours to Mr. Raigorodsky?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, sir; that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Reporter, mark those documents, if you will, as "De Mohrenschildt
Exhibits 7 and 16."</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked "De Mohrenschildt Exhibits 7 and
16" for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On September 12, you appear to have transmitted some additional
materials to Mr. Raigorodsky. I hold in my hand three documents.</p>

<p>The first, a photostatic copy of an envelope, with your letterhead in the upper
left-hand corner, your Dallas office, addressed to Mr. Paul Raigorodsky.</p>

<p>The second, a letter signed "George and Jeanne" over a typewritten signature,
"Jeanne and George De Mohrenschildt."</p>

<p>Is the George and Jeanne in handwriting your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this letter is dated September 12, 1963. You transmitted
that letter to Mr. Raigorodsky?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, indeed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the envelope we have just identified. And did you also
enclose the third document, which is a diagram <span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Of the planned development in Haiti.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it has in the lower left-hand corner in longhand "Credits
available for these industries&mdash;George De M., Dallas, September 11, 1963." Is
that your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, indeed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you also send Mr. Raigorodsky a map of Haiti, in which
you&mdash;excuse me.</p>

<p>Mr. Reporter, would you mark the three documents I have just identified as De
Mohrenschildt Exhibits 8, 9, and 10.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked "De Mohrenschildt Exhibits 8, 9,
and 10" for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Reporter, identify the next document as De Mohrenschildt
Exhibit No. 11.</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked "De Mohrenschildt Exhibit No. 11" for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For the purpose of the record, it is the description map of
Haiti. This is a map published by the Texaco Co., and it is available to anybody
who wants to pick up a map at a gasoline service station, is it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is not a fancy geologist's map, for example?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you send that to Mr. Raigorodsky?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, indeed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There is some longhand on it, do you see that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is that your longhand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the upper right-hand <span class="locked">corner&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It shows the possibility <span class="locked">for&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. I just want you to read the words, and not
elaborate. I am going to have you elaborate on them. There is in the upper
right-hand corner first near the letter "A" of "Atlantic," an arrow pointing to
the left, to a small island. What are the words there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. "New resorts."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And then to the right of that inscription, there are three lines
of words, and an arrow pointing to an area in which I see the word "Caracol."
Read those words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. "New resort, Chou-Chou Beach."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, in the lower left-hand portion of the upper right-hand quadrant there
appears an inscription with an arrow pointing to "Mont Rouis." And then
below that, over what appears to be a series of islands encircled, there appears
more writing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. "Oil possibilities on this island."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Do the words "on this island" appear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No. Just "oil possibilities."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am just getting the wording first, and then I will have you
explain it all later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. "Our Shada concession."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, the words "Our Shada concession" are the words at the
lead end of the arrow which points to Mont Rouis, which you have already
identified in the record.</p>

<p>Now, to the extreme right, and at the margin, opposite the inscriptions we
have just described, there is some more writing. Would you read that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. "Brown and Root built this dam."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, there is an encirclement around&mdash;between the
two we have identified, but above&mdash;it looks as though the center of this island
here&mdash;there is an inscription. This appears in the area&mdash;there is an X there&mdash;an
airplane indication Hinche and there is some writing. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. "Oil possibilities."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, Port-au-Prince is encircled. Then at the
bottom, which is the lower right-hand quadrant, there is an arrow pointed to
Pationville. And that arrow leads to some handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. "Ibolele Hotel."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, to the left of that inscription, and in the center of the
map, the lower half, there is an encirclement that encircles an area, the chief
town of which appears to be what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Lescayes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what is written there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. "Oil possibilities."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I guess we have gotten everything you have written on
there. Now, with those papers, would you proceed to tell us now about your
Haitian venture, and take those papers, since they seem to be in some order of
sequence as to time, and tell us all about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In other words, this venture is no mite, is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No. It started&mdash;it already started by my previous
work there in 1956. It is the result of many trips I took to Haiti in the meantime.
And it is a result of an effort which started in 1961.</p>

<p>I have in my possession a letter from the minister of mines <span class="locked">which&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of what country?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Of Haiti. Dated in 1961, giving me an opportunity
to present a geological survey of Haiti.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was that to be for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. This was to search and study the oil and gas and all
the mineralogical points of the whole country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did this have anything, any purpose or intent, other than a
legitimate effort on your part, on behalf of the Haitian Government, to you as
a petroleum engineer and geologist, to discover in Haiti mineral deposits that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
might be of economic value to Haiti, and to those who might be willing to risk
their capital to develop it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. This is the only purpose I have&mdash;purely business
promotional project.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this is in no way linked, directly, indirectly, or in any remote
possibility, with any mapping of this country with great care for the possibility
of its being employed by any other nation or group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; no other nation could use my maps, and no other
project, except our own commercial and geological project&mdash;nothing else.</p>

<p>Anyway, the whole Island of Haiti has been mapped in complete precision by
the U.S. Government already, and the maps are available right here in Washington.
And my office in Port-au-Prince, actually they are officers of Inter-American
Geodetic Survey.</p>

<p>On one side is the American representative of the Geodetic Survey, and on the
other side I am doing my geological work in the same building. He helps me
with some of his equipment, some of his advice, some of his maps, and we pursue
our own work there.</p>

<p>I employed in the last 8 months since we have been in Haiti an Italian geologist
who came specially to Haiti from South America, with all the equipment, and
stayed with us for several months. I employed a Swiss assistant. I employed&mdash;I
am employing an American geologist right now, recommended by the
University of Texas, who is living in Haiti with his family, and whose salary
I am paying; I am responsible for him.</p>

<p>I have also, in addition to that, employed a prospector from Alaska, an American.
And I am employing a group of Haitian engineers and geologists&mdash;engineers,
not geologists, because they don't have geologists. Engineers. And it is
a project which&mdash;for which the Haitian Government is supposed to pay me $285,000,
out of which they pay $20,000 in cash, and the rest they are paying from
the interest in the sisal plantation at Mont Rouis.</p>

<p>This plantation started to be operated jointly by Mr. Clemard J. Charles,
president of the Commercial Bank of Haiti, and myself; and now Mr. Charles
is operating it for me, doing all the administrative work, and I am pursuing my
geological work.</p>

<p>Up to now, we found some things which were indicated on the map here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I don't want you to reveal any business secret, because I appreciate&mdash;all
I am getting at is the general description of the project, and its
good faith.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right. I hope that this will be sufficiently
justified in good faith.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And these documents we have identified are documents which you
sent to Mr. Raigorodsky with what thought in mind?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. With the thought of having him eventually participate
in various enterprises which may come out of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Such as?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Such as development of small industries, development
of oil production, development of new hotels and new resorts, et cetera.
Because the country is open to new business and I think has excellent opportunities
for American investments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, you have expressed an opinion, have you not, as
to the activity or lack of activity on the part of the FBI in connection with the
assassination of the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I think that they should have sent away from
Dallas every suspicious person, like any other country would do&mdash;when somebody&mdash;when
an important figure arrives to town, and there are deranged people,
or people who have habits of shooting guns at targets or ones who have been
traitors to their country to some extent, you know&mdash;any controversial people
should be not necessarily put to jail, but sent away from the town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have Lee Oswald in mind, do you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I have Lee Oswald in mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You assume that the FBI was aware that he had this weapon,
and he was target practicing with it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That I do not know, whether they had that knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
of the weapon. But it is not for me to judge them. But I think they
should have known. If they didn't know, they should have known.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And I take it your opinion, whether they did or did not know of
the weapon, they had other information with respect to Oswald's attempted
defection and matters of that nature which you <span class="locked">feel&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. They must have had that information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And as an American citizen, it is your view that they should have
done what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think they should have&mdash;in my opinion, they
shouldn't have let him come back to the United States&mdash;No. 1.</p>

<p>And No. 2, the people like us should have been protected against even knowing
people like Oswald. Maybe I am wrong in that respect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, it is an opinion. That is all I am asking you for.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. And thirdly, Oswald was known as a violent character,
especially in the last time. He was known, as I read from the papers, that
he participated in pro-Castro demonstrations in New Orleans. That is what I
read in the papers. And so therefore, he should have been kept away from
Dallas when the President was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Reporter, would you mark the Auchincloss letter, dated
February 2, 1964, and its accompanying envelope as De Mohrenschildt Exhibits
12 and 13, respectively?</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked "De Mohrenschildt Exhibits 12 and
13," for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the Auchincloss letter of December 12, 1963, and its accompanying
envelope as De Mohrenschildt Exhibits 14 and 15, respectively.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked "De Mohrenschildt Exhibits 14
and 15," for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. All these contracts in Haiti have been made official
by an act of Congress of Haiti on March 13, 1963, and signed by the president
of the country and by all the ministers, stipulating that the price of the geological
survey would be $285,000, and the consideration for it will be the concession
of the sisal in Haiti, originally an American company called Shada,
built by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and developed during the war, and
later on sold to the Haitian Government. This concession is given to me for
the duration of 10 years, with an extended duration of 10 years more. I think
that will explain it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I could talk for hours about this project, because it
was developed through so many years, and so much effort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In order that the correspondence be complete, Mr. De Mohrenschildt
has produced for me the response he received to his letter of December 12,
1963, to Mrs. Auchincloss.</p>

<p>Mr. De Mohrenschildt, since it is a personal letter, I will ask you to read the
letter in evidence. It has a longhand note on it. You might want to keep the
original. So just read it. And just for the purpose of the record, and not
because I suspicion you, I will watch you read it.</p>

<p>It is on letterhead, 3044 O Street, Northwest, Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>"Dear George:</p>

<p>"Thank you for your letter and for your sympathy for Jacqueline. Please
accept my deepest sympathy in the loss of your son. How tragic for you.</p>

<p>"It seems extraordinary to me that you knew Oswald and that you knew
Jackie as a child. It is certainly a very strange world."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Hold it a minute. The second paragraph begins with the words
"It seems."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. "You did not say why you were in Haiti, so I imagine
that you are in our Foreign Service. If you come to Washington again,
I would like to talk with you, and I would very much like to meet your wife.
When you next write to Dimitri, will you send him my warmest regards, and
thank him for his sympathy."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Dimitri is your brother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, there is a longhand note.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>"I live now in Georgetown. Your letter has made me think a good deal. I
hope too&mdash;that Mrs. Oswald will not suffer.</p>

<p>"Very sincerely, Janet Lee Auchincloss."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Dated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Wednesday, January 29.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. You just keep that original.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I show you what purports to be a transcript of a Christmas card,
1963, allegedly transmitted by you, appearing at page 3, Commission Document
703-F. Would you read it, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. This paragraph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The whole card.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. "Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. Best
wishes for 1964, George and Jeanne De M.</p>

<p>"Alex is in New York State, supposedly working at some mental hospital.
Gary Taylor takes care of Cousin Lil. Nancy is alive, still kicking. We are
happy here. Appalled at the crimes in Dallas.</p>

<p>"George."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You transmitted that Christmas card with that inscription?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would you explain your statement, "appalled at the crimes
in Dallas"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I mean the assassination of the President
and subsequent assassination of Lee Oswald by Ruby, and the assassination by
Oswald of this policeman&mdash;three assassinations, one after another.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. By the way, did you ever see Jack Ruby in the flesh?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Never; no. On TV you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No.</p>

<p>Did you know him when you were in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To the best of your recollection, had you ever seen him when
you were in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was his name ever mentioned at any conversation that took
place in the presence of Lee Oswald while you were present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was at any time there any conversation, or did anything occur
while you were in Dallas to lead you to believe directly or indirectly, or to any
degree whatsoever, that Lee Oswald knew Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No, sir; not one indication.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did anything occur in Dallas by way of any statements to you,
statements made in your presence, or anything you noticed or saw, that would
lead you at any time while you were in Dallas, to lead you to believe that Lee
Oswald was ever in the Carousel Club in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you try to interest Mr. Kitchel in your Haiti venture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he did not join?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was a friendly gesture on your part, was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am pleased to say to you that he so regarded it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I am glad to hear that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That he thought you were in good faith, offering him an opportunity
to participate, and you were not thinking in terms of any business
advantage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is the fact; is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; of course. I offered this project to quite a few
people, and it so happened that at the time they were afraid of Haiti, and I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
very happy to say that I am now the sole proprietor of the whole project. It
may be all for the best.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will show the witness pages 4, 5 and 6 and 7 of Commission
Document No. 542. I wish to direct your attention primarily to the&mdash;what purports
to be a letter from you to Mr. Kitchel, setting forth the background of
information on a holding company that you were developing in Haiti. Would
you read the letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. "Haitian Holding Company."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. It may already be in evidence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. "August 1, 1962."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think not&mdash;but if you will hold a minute. What I have just
shown you is a copy of De Mohrenschildt Exhibit No. 6.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, sir; this was followed, of course, by many other
letters and correspondence with our prospective investors and people who might
be interested in a mining development of Haiti.</p>

<p>I am negotiating right now with an aluminum company for the development of
bauxite, and with oil companies in regard to development of oil possibilities.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. De Mohrenschildt, we have had some discussions off the
record, and I had lunch with you a couple of times. Is there anything that we
discussed during the course of any off-the-record discussions which I have not
already brought out on the record that you think is pertinent and should be
brought out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't remember any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. None occurs to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I don't know everything by any means. I will ask you this
general question. Is there anything else, despite all our careful investigation,
and my questioning of you at some length, that you think is pertinent and might
be helpful to the Commission in its important work, and if you can think of
anything, would you please mention it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Frankly, I cannot think of anything else you could
do. All the rest&mdash;what else can you do except investigate as much as you can?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. De Mohrenschildt, you appear here voluntarily and at some
inconvenience?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And on behalf of the Commission, and the Commission staff, I
want to express our appreciation to you for having come to this country, at some
inconvenience, and your answering my questions here for 2 days spontaneously
and directly. Some of them have been highly personal. But you have exhibited
no discomfiture because they have been personal. We appreciate your assistance
and your help.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I hope I have been helpful to some extent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, as I spoke to you yesterday, you have a right to read your
deposition, and to sign it, and you told me I think yesterday that you would
like to read it over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. If it won't be a very lengthy job and very hurried job
to do that, and inconvenience the reporter. I think I have said everything I
could know. I don't think I could add or change very much. It is all right as
far as I am concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As far as you are concerned, you would just as soon waive the
necessity of reading and signing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. If I made a mistake, it was involuntary. I might
have missed a date or something. But I did to the best of my ability.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We will have your deposition by tomorrow. And Mrs. De
Mohrenschildt will be here tomorrow.</p>

<p>If you would like to come over and read it, you may. Otherwise, if you don't
return to read it, we will consider that you have waived it.</p>

<p>I offer in evidence the exhibits I have heretofore marked, being De Mohrenschildt
Exhibits 1 through 16, inclusive.</p>

<h2 id="jdm">TESTIMONY OF JEANNE DE MOHRENSCHILDT</h2>

<p>The testimony of Jeanne De Mohrenschildt was taken at 4:45 p.m., on April
23, 1964, at 200 Maryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C. by Mr. Albert E.
Jenner, Jr., assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, and nothing but the
truth, in the course of your deposition which I am about to take?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are Mrs. George S. De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Why "S"? The "S" doesn't belong there at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, he acknowledged that it does.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. S?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. Sergei.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I have a brother by the same name Sergei, and he
had a son by the name Sergei. Maybe he wants to add the letter to our name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No. It shows in the records for many, many years.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I never knew that. Sergei is his father's name&mdash;that
is what it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have a brother whose name is Sergei, do you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Sergei Michail Fomenko.</p>

<p>Give me your full maiden name. Your name as you were born and given
to you by your parents.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. The first name will be Eugenia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">And&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I have no middle name. Just Fomenko.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, your mother's name was Tatiana?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Tatiana. My father, Michail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your father was Michail L.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. That is for&mdash;his father was Lev.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were born in China?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Our information is it was at Harbin.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is the nearest town?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Nearest town to what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Harbin.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I would not&mdash;I cannot say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What part of China?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It is Manchuria. The northern part of China,
close to the Siberian border.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean the Russian-Chinese border?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have a sister?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. From what I recall, we had a&mdash;we had three portraits
in the house, of children&mdash;my portrait, my brother's portrait, and there
was a portrait of a little girl. And the portrait&mdash;she was about 3 or 4 years old.
I don't know how, where did they get that idea, or was I actually told&mdash;but she
is supposed to be my half-sister&mdash;Alexandra her name was supposed to be.
And I think my father was married before he married my mother, but, you
know, they don't tell much to children, and we never asked anything. We have
never had any curiosity about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are a naturalized citizen of this Nation, are you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you naturalized on April 6, 1936?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No&mdash;couldn't. I came here in 1938. How could
you possibly get that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. I am misadvised. I was looking at the wrong thing.
You were naturalized when?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I believe it was 1945, but I cannot be absolutely sure.
I have my papers in the hotel. 1944 or 1945, maybe it is 1944. If you want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
the exact date, I can easily get it for you. Do you actually have information,
naturalized in 1936?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No, I don't. I have your immigration record here. I will find
it in a moment. You became a U.S. citizen in proceedings in the U.S. district
court, in New York City, February 28, 1945.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. 1945.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you born on May 5, 1914?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your parents, were they Russian citizens?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. My father took a Chinese passport, and I cannot
tell you whether he already had it when I was born, or whether he took one
later. But I believe he took one later. He took probably one later, when they
sold the railroad to the Reds, you know. That is when he took the Chinese
passport.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was born in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your mother was born in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. To my knowledge, yes. They were living a few
years in China before I was born.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, in what business or occupation or government service
was your father engaged?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. My father was in charge of the Far Eastern railroad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For what country?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. For China. He was working directly with the
Chinese Government and with Chinese officials, with Chinese people. And
then in 1925, when the Chinese sold the <span class="locked">railroad&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In 1925, the Chinese people sold the railroad to
the Russians, and they changed the tracks, connected with the Trans-Siberian
Railroad. My father resigned. And he received quite a lot of money from
that. He had been in the service for quite a few years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were 11 years old then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. 1925; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were personally aware of this event?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Oh, yes; I knew about that. I cannot tell you&mdash;that
is recollections of the past. And he started to build another railroad on
his own called HoHi Railroad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me.</p>

<p>You came to this country on August 4, 1938.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Right; San Francisco.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, your father, as you said, was director of a
Chinese Eastern railroad.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I was looking for some papers here. The Chinese sold the railroad
to Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was in 1925?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is how I understood it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In any event, your father ceased at that time to be director
of the Chinese Eastern Railroad.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right. He resigned, and in fact we were
planning to come to the United States, the whole family. We wanted to come
to the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Just because it is not our country to live there
forever. We were brought up with white people, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why did your father resign when the railroad was sold to the
Russians?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Because from what I know they wanted him to
take a Communist passport, and he refused.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he anti-Communist?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is from what I know he is supposed to have
Chinese passport.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he anti-Communist?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Oh, absolutely, absolutely. He was&mdash;not the chief,
but the elderly friend for the Scouts. We had a wonderful Scout organization,
Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts. He was very, very active in that. He was sort
of like a patron for it. We have a marvelous organization in China. In fact,
I didn't see anywhere in the world yet&mdash;how well it was conducted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, what happened to your father eventually?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. We never could, since 1941, right after Pearl <span class="locked">Harbor&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. After Pearl Harbor, we didn't have any communications
at all, neither myself nor my brother. We tried to check through the
Red Cross and find out. Nothing could be done. We just couldn't find out.
Whenever I saw some people that returned from China, came over, and whenever
I asked them what happened to my parents, did you see them, how are
they, they never said a word, said they didn't know, they just disappeared.
Then in 1957, when I saw my brother, he told me that he didn't want to tell me,
but he found out in 1945 and he knew then they were both dead for quite a
while already. Father was killed by the Communists.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which Communists?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I don't know which ones&mdash;the Chinese or
Reds or Japanese&mdash;I don't know who. And he was taken on the railroad&mdash;that
is, usual procedure, they take you on a car somewhere and shoot you. And
my brother told me he died in 1941. I don't know how he found out. I assume
and I think that the American government helped him, because he is in rather
secret work. He could not possibly do it, having <span class="locked">parents&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is your brother who lives out in California?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you eventually&mdash;before you came to the United States,
were you married?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I was married to my first husband.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you marry in China?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what was the name of your first husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He had a few first names, and to tell you the truth
I don't know which one is the right one. I cannot say. Because half of the
friends called him by one name, half of the friends called him by the other
name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. The first name was Valentin, and the second one
was Bob&mdash;they called him Bob. So which one is right, I don't know. But I
liked Bob better.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was his last name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. His last name was Bogoiavlensky.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were married when?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I believe we were married in 1932, in the fall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In what business or profession was your husband engaged when
you were married?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, at the time when we were married, he was&mdash;we
were both working, making designs and constructions&mdash;making plans and
building houses together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you associated in business?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It wasn't exactly business. I don't know&mdash;it is not
done like it is done in the United States. We just knew how to build houses,
we knew all the measurements and everything, and we had the project&mdash;somebody
wanted a house of such and such dimensions, we would design it, make
all the blueprints, and then we had worked with contractors and had the building
constructed. And then I believe he was also working in the&mdash;the Japanese
were building their airport.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In Harbin. And he was helping and surveying the
grounds or something. This I don't know, because I wasn't present&mdash;something
on this order. And that is what really actually made us leave north in a hurry
and go south, because the Japanese started to grab all the people that knew
anything at all close to those plants. They wanted to keep everything very,
very secret. So quite a few of our friends just disappeared overnight.</p>

<p>And then in a couple of weeks they may appear again half dead already,
completely beaten to a pulp and so on. Quite a few things started to go on. And
then somebody mentioned that they didn't like the idea that we knew too much
about the plants or something of the airport and said we better leave, and we
just left with very, very few things. We took a train and went south, and went
to Shanghai, and lived in Shanghai, until we were ready to come to the United
States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. While you were in China, were you and your husband&mdash;did you
engage as a dancing team?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I was dancing quite well.</p>

<p>You see, when you travel like that you cannot just get another job somewhere.
So he was helping me. He helped me as a partner. And I danced a solo.</p>

<p>We did that in Tientsin. And then Shanghai.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And in order to support <span class="locked">yourselves&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. We were a dancing team.</p>

<p>You see, it was a temporary period, but if things go well, we were doing very
well really. Fate does strange things to you&mdash;throws you from one profession
to another. You think it is the greatest tragedy&mdash;I will tell you later what happened
to me&mdash;and it is the best, actually.</p>

<p>So it was working out very well. We were quite successful. And then
something happened later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, did you change your name at this period of your life?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. We changed the name when we started dancing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you changed your name to what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. LeGon. We picked up the name out of the dancing
magazine. But with this name&mdash;you see how it happens. You get so involved
that you have to stick to it. You cannot just&mdash;you knew&mdash;because some
people know you by this name, then you start with another name, and it sounds
ridiculous. But since then already we had it. And we intended that when
we came over, we are going to adopt it, because personally I don't think it is
fair to our friend, and it is not fair for the country to use a name like
Bogoiavlensky, or a name like De Mohrenschildt. If it would be up to me, I
would cut the other one down.</p>

<p>It took me 3 months to learn to pronounce that name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There have been some people that because of the name LeGon&mdash;that
you had some French. You are not French?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No, I will tell you. I had to start in New York to
do something, had a little girl a year old, and my husband had terrible trouble
to get any kind of work. He was making $18 a week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In 1938?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; it was 1940, 1941, when my little girl was born.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your daughter was born in this country?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your daughter's name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is why I could not dance any more. I had to
drop completely dancing and everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, that you have mentioned your daughter, let's cover her.</p>

<p>What was her given name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Her given name was Jeanne Elinor LeGon. Also
after a dancer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Eleanor Powell?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, exactly. And being unaware&mdash;you see, in
Europe if you have two names, the first name is important, the second one is
usually your mother's or somebody, and you have it just in case.</p>

<p>In the States the last name is the one that counts&mdash;the previous names don't
mean much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
So when she was born, we were not citizens yet, and we didn't have a legal
paper of changing our name to LeGon. So in her birth certificate I put down
Jeanne Elinor LeGon and just in case, Bogoiavlensky, so just in case something
happened to us she would not be an orphan thrown somewhere&mdash;I was so
afraid something would go wrong and she would be put out of the country
or something&mdash;she was born here, and that is her name, and I put that
Bogoiavlensky on the birth certificate.</p>

<p>And that started the whole uproar.</p>

<p>And besides&mdash;I lost her birth certificate once when I needed it for a passport&mdash;I
could not find it, because I was looking under "L"&mdash;I told them to look under
"L". And for months they were looking under "L" and then it dawned on me,
did I put, by any chance, Bogoiavlensky.</p>

<p>So they filed it under "B".</p>

<p>Well, it is my own fault&mdash;I asked for it. I can't get rid of that name.</p>

<p>It is a pretty name. In fact, it is a very novel name. But I don't think it
belongs in this country. I think it is ridiculous for people to have such long
names. If you are a priest's family, that would be fine. But not for us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was your daughter born?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She mas born April 30, 1941.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I might go back with your husband.</p>

<p>Where was your husband born, your first husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. From what I know, he was born in&mdash;I think in
Russia&mdash;and brought out as a very, very little boy. And I never met his father.
His mother was supposed to be dead when he was born. I only knew his stepmother,
who was absolutely wonderful.</p>

<p>He had two half brothers, charming boys, and they were both lost in the
war with China and Japan. We never could find them. One of them was
with the British forces and another with the French forces. And I understand
one was sent to Hong Kong, and the other remained in Shanghai. And we
never heard from them.</p>

<p>So that is one of the really big tragedies. We were anxious to find them,
because we were going to get them over here. They had good heads. They
could grow up very fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have always regarded the United States as a haven?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Absolutely. It was the country by choice, because we
could have gone to Europe. But I didn't want anything&mdash;this was from so and
so. I said I wanted to have a country where everything is new and fresh, and
if I break something I go to the store and buy another one.</p>

<p>I never have anything you can break. It was just because I was brought
up with furniture with little gilded things in it, I don't want any part of it.
I have been in Europe about 15 times after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I know you have.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. And I enjoy being there for a few weeks. But I
would never live in Europe. I would not be happy.</p>

<p>If I had to, I would live there, but I don't like&mdash;the whole atmosphere doesn't
appeal to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There have been various reports on your views with respect
to Russia and communism.</p>

<p>What are your views?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. What I am?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What are your views?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. My views?</p>

<p>Well, I tell you. I am not a Communist by all means at all. I think that
revolution in Russia was inevitable. It is just horrible that it happened that
way, and it was so bloody, and so many <span class="locked">people&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are talking now about the revolution of the 1920's?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. 1917, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1918, 1919.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. 1917, 1918&mdash;that is when it started. I know in fact
very little of the whole thing, because at home there was never any conversation&mdash;too
many people were killed. In fact, from what I understand, all the families<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
of my father and mother were killed, too. So we never had any conversation
about it. We just were kept away from the whole thing.</p>

<p>And, beside, I deliberately stayed away from all of that. I said it is none
of my business, I have never been there, I don't know what it is all about,
I don't want to know anything about it. I don't want to be prejudiced to
anything.</p>

<p>But after, later on, when I grew up and the revolution was necessary, it
is just too bad it happened like that.</p>

<p>And I do hope that the country eventually will come out and become human
again, and I think it is getting to be more and more human.</p>

<p>But it is still a far cry from freedom, from the freedom like we have. That
was the most wonderful thing. When I came here&mdash;unfortunately, I landed
in New York. I didn't want to, but my brother was in New York and he said
you come right away to New York.</p>

<p>I love California, because of the climate. I like sunshine. So I came to
New York, and New York, of course, was very depressing to me, because it
was dirty. And I had an idea that all the white countries and white cities
must be clean, because white people are not supposed to spit on the floor, and
they don't throw papers around. They are supposed to be well mannered.</p>

<p>And then I came in in that awful New York. And, of course, I had almost
no money. I had to use subways. It was very, very bad.</p>

<p>But then I saw all of a sudden on the street there is a gathering of people,
somebody is standing and shouting and talking and saying anything he wants
to. And I said, what is going on? They said he is just saying something&mdash;I
forgot what it was all about. But how people were talking freely and expressing
themselves openly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They had a right to do that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; And in China&mdash;you see, we were always&mdash;we
never could say anything openly, for many reasons.</p>

<p>First, I don't know, but I assume there was a lot of Red spies probably
everywhere. So we could never say too much.</p>

<p>Then there were Japanese that came over. We couldn't say anything again.</p>

<p>So we were trained as children just to be quiet, never talk because you never
know who may overhear, and then tomorrow goodbye, something will happen
to you. That is the atmosphere that I was brought up in.</p>

<p>I wish my husband would be brought up in that atmosphere, because sometimes
he says things&mdash;of course, being European, he likes to see Russia.</p>

<p>I said, yes, but not yet, because you would not last there for 2 days, you
would be shot in 2 days. He doesn't feel that there is a place, places that you
cannot be like he is. You just cannot do it. Maybe that is why he has so
much trouble, because he just talks anything he wants to say, and people misinterpret
it. People misinterpret it, and then they hear something, somebody
repeated, already something else, and then they say he says something bad.
This is really terrible. This is many, many times, you know. But he learned
his lesson now. Living in Haiti we cannot talk very much, either, with Papa
Doc. You know the regime there now. He is quite a dictator. He is going
to be pronounced the king now, at the end of May. And, of course, there is
tremendous opposition against it. It is not for our sake, but for our Haitian
friends' sake, we cannot say anything.</p>

<p>So he learned a little bit of the atmosphere where you cannot talk.</p>

<p>He said&mdash;"I am so glad we went to Haiti, because I have no desire to go to
Russia."</p>

<p>That was wonderful. It was music to my ears.</p>

<p>I said, "Now, you learn."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. But some day I hope, anyway. I would like to see it.
I would like to go down south to the Crimea which I understand is beautiful,
the Black Sea. I would like to see all the world.</p>

<p>I saw quite a lot.</p>

<p>But I would like to see that, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your brother, Sergei, he came over to this country, did he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. What?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Don't you have a brother by the name <span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Did he what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He came to this country?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Oh, yes. I believe he came in 1930.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he is still here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And where is he located now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He is in Woodland Hills, Calif.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Engaged <span class="locked">in&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think it is 4560 Deseret Drive.</p>

<p>He is with North American Aircraft Co. He just switched. He was with
Ramo Wooldridge. A few years before that he was with Linnet Co. in Beverly
Hills, and before that with Howard Hughes, and before that he was with
Berkeley, University at Berkeley, doing some research.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He attended the University of Chicago?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He attended after the war. But he originally came
over to study in Berkeley. He graduated from Berkeley. But then when the war
broke out he volunteered&mdash;he was 2½ years in service. But he was never sent
over, because he did so much important research work, that they kept him here.</p>

<p>And he met Professor Rasby of Chicago University. And then he went to
work with him in Chicago University for very, very little money, but he had
all the facilities for his work. That is where he met his second wife, a very
lovely woman, and they are very happy now, I hope. Four little kinds, darling
home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you eventually were divorced from your first husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He retained the name Robert LeGon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He didn't change his name back to Bogoiavlensky?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>By the way, do you know he is in a rest home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. There was a lot of unpleasantness around in that
time, because he was already going off completely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were divorced from him in the summer of 1959?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Oh, no, no; before that. It was 1957, spring of
1957. Yes; it was in the spring of 1957.</p>

<p>I believe it was first of May or something. I don't remember exactly. But
it is pretty close.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you married your present husband, George De Mohrenschildt,
in the summer of 1959?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. 1959, yes; in June, towards the end of June.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your daughter who was born to you in New York <span class="locked">City&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In Manhattan Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was&mdash;her given name <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Jeanne Elinor LeGon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she changed her name to Christiana?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; her father did it. She was just a youngster.</p>

<p>You know what happened to him mentally. He went completely&mdash;I don't know,
maybe when people go crazy, lots of things begin to bother them, maybe
his conscience was bothering him because he dropped his father's name or
something. But for a particular reason he didn't take it himself, but he put it&mdash;insisted
that my daughter will take the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Bogoiavlensky&mdash;and drop the LeGon. And she
was baptized&mdash;she was brought up as Episcopalian. I never baptized her, because
I wanted her to choose her own religion when she grew up. I know too
many people who have too many difficulties later when they find out they want
something else. By the time she was baptized she liked the name Christiana
and she took that name. And he changed her name to Bogoiavlensky again.
So it was very, very unpleasant and horrible, what the poor fellow didn't do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he cause you some difficulty with respect to accusing you
of being a Communist?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't know if you have a letter, I wish I would
have a letter what he did. You see I had charge accounts throughout the country,
because I was making very good money. Lord and Taylor, Saks, all the biggest
restaurants everywhere. And when that happened, I actually told him that is the
end, I am divorcing you, and that is it, and there will be no change back, nothing
at all, he sent out letters to all of these places, to all the restaurants, all the
department stores, including Niemans, and I believe Niemans showed me the
letter, and there was a Golden Pheasant Restaurant&mdash;they showed me the
letter&mdash;that so and so, and he expressed in a horrible way that Eugenia Fomenko
Bogoiavlensky, my ex-wife, she is&mdash;almost putting that I am a spy, and God
knows what in it, and that he is not responsible for my debts, for my accounts.</p>

<p>It was 1957, and since 1941 I was the one that made all the money in the
family. I was the one making all these things, bringing up my child. So that
was horrible. That is not all. He sent letters, and he signed "FBI"&mdash;make
believe they are from the FBI. He sent to all my people in New York, firms that
I work with, that also I am a spy or something, this and that, horrible.</p>

<p>And I was in Europe that summer. And a friend of mine came over and said,
"What is the matter with you?" She said, "What happened to you? The FBI
are looking for you."</p>

<p>I said, "Are you kidding me?"</p>

<p>She said "No;" one of the manufacturers showed her the letter.</p>

<p>I said, "For God sakes, this is ridiculous, I never heard of such a thing."</p>

<p>So when I come back to New York I right away went to see all of them.</p>

<p>They said, some were laughing about it. But some I know they had a little
something behind their heads.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They were worried?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; even a thing like that, a prank like that,
already set people thinking. And do you know that I could not get a job in New
York, just because of that? And, fortunately, being in Texas, I switched to
designing dresses and sportswear, and I had two jobs in no time in that market.</p>

<p>And I was able to get&mdash;I lost my job in Texas while I was in Europe because
of that.</p>

<p>He sent that to my employer.</p>

<p>I never told that&mdash;I don't know if my present husband knows it&mdash;because that
would really kill him, a thing like that.</p>

<p>But it was eventually straightened out. But I was actually out, I couldn't get
a job, my daughter had to go to the university, I had to send her money. I had
nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where was she attending a university?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. UCLA.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In 1957. Fall of 1957.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your daughter come to live with you right after she <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She came over for summer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In 1957?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I will tell you. It is really a very tragic thing.
I knew I should have dropped this when she was 6 years old, because he was a
very, very wonderful person, her father. But we just had different views on
life, and liked to do entirely different things. And he just could not adapt himself
to the country.</p>

<p>I know a few people that when they lose everything they are lost. Whatever
we had, it is never the same. It never was good enough. Our daughter would
never have what we had in childhood.</p>

<p>He was from a very wealthy family, and, fortunately, I was, too.</p>

<p>I said, "For goodness sakes, who cares? We are alive. How many people
are dead already? We are here. It is a new country. We will make what we
want to make out of it."</p>

<p>I started from $25 a week. And in New York I was making $1,100 a week.
That is what you can do in this country, if you put your mind to it, and you
work. And if you don't have a negative attitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
But he could not. Even when we had a nice home in California, with beautiful
bay window, and the ocean, you can see Catalina Island and everything. He said,
"No; at our house we had 30 people for dinner every day." It is awful. He never
could get adjusted to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But he wasn't earning a living, was he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; he wasn't. He was always&mdash;you see, I understand
from talking to doctors&mdash;he was off for quite a while, which I didn't know.
I didn't know it. And it never occurred to me. We were brought up maybe 200
years set back. This was the husband, and that is the way it is, and that is the
way it is going to be, so whatever it is that is how it is going to stay. So it never
occurred to me there could be different ways, something wrong with him mentally.
In fact, my brother many times mentioned he should go to a psychiatrist and
find out why he should have such an attitude, but I laughed at my brother.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, maybe I should have listened to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us a little bit&mdash;you came to this country. Did you and
your husband attempt to resort again to your ballroom dancing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. We were supposed to. We had auditions with Moss
and Hart, very successful. And we were almost ready to have a contract in
the Rainbow Room. And then I became pregnant with my little girl. And that
really shattered us to pieces. We are awfully happy to have a child, but that
was not the time to have the child. We had to leave everything in China, because
we had to cross all Japan. So that was&mdash;at the time it was just like a tragedy.
And after she was born, I could never dance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, after the birth of your daughter, did you&mdash;what did you
do to sustain your family?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I stayed home for 1 year. We just lived on whatever
he made. Because I wanted to bring her up&mdash;I don't believe in nurses. I
like to bring my own child up, train her for everything, in whatever a little baby
should be trained.</p>

<p>And then if he could possibly make a little better, I would not go to work.</p>

<p>But then I saw he is not getting any better, but he is getting more and more
depressed, and is getting worse. He just didn't care. He had that attitude,
"I don't care." I said if that is his attitude, if I don't do something, my daughter
will have nothing altogether. So I started to think. What could I do?
I spoke English, but crazy pigeon English.</p>

<p>I couldn't do anything architecturally, because I don't know the terminology.
I can automatically make the drawings, but I would not be able to render it.
It would be impossible for me to have anything.</p>

<p>And then actually, without knowing anything, I became a model. I had
two lessons, and I pretended that I was very experienced. I fooled everybody.
And I somehow got a job as a model.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;at one place it didn't work out, because it was very depressing
and horrible atmosphere. On Seventh Avenue it is no joke.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. My daughter is a model.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Probably with a good firm.</p>

<p>I have a couple of firms that are fantastic. And then I switched to Leeds
Ltd. And within 1 year, from modeling, from 25, I became in charge of the
showroom. I was selling, I was selecting fabrics, and became a stylist.</p>

<p>And then gradually my salary was increasing and increasing, and I have
been with them for 7 years.</p>

<p>But to start with, I worked 7 days a week. I worked even Sunday, until 1
o'clock&mdash;that is how hard I worked.</p>

<p>And the very same firm paid me in 1957 to design a collection for them, the
same clothes I did 10 years ago&mdash;$500 for 5 days, for 4½ days. So you see
what you can do if you put yourself to it. Only in the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A country of opportunity.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. If you want to.</p>

<p>That is what Marina&mdash;that is why I get mad with her. I told her, "Marina,
look at me."</p>

<p>Let's not talk about Marina now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I want to get to that. But I would like to cover this background
first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
You continued as a designer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I switched firms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of Leeds Wearing Apparel?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; then I started to travel to Europe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You made frequent trips to Europe?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Twice a year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, eventually, you reached Texas. How did that
happen?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, my daughter had asthma. She is a very allergic
child. And her health was really terrible. In spite of all the care given
to her, she just could not stand the New York climate. And our family doctor
said the only way to save her&mdash;she was getting really sick from antibiotics and
penicillin&mdash;is to change the climate.</p>

<p>So I was very anxious to change the climate&mdash;going to California, that was
my aim.</p>

<p>But I could not reach California. Mr. Gold, of Nardis Sportswear in New
York, wanted to open a suit department. And, of course, the buyers did know
me all over the country&mdash;the same buyers&mdash;recommended to get in touch with
me and engage me. And it was pretty good. It was $20,000 a year, plus two
trips to Europe, with expenses paid, and about $7,000 to buy the models&mdash;you
just cannot go in and look at the shows.</p>

<p>So I decided I am going to go and do it. And Texas is better climatewise
than New York.</p>

<p>And, believe me, my daughter never had asthma since she left New York. It
is a fantastic change.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, when did you go to Texas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I went to Texas in 1953, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1953. Did your husband accompany you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I came in the summer, and then I had to go immediately
to Europe. And he came over in the fall, when my daughter returned
from camp. He came over in the fall, and then shipped all the furniture.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, I stayed with the Golds. They have a very big <span class="locked">mansion&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your husband left Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; he came in the fall of 1953.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He came in the fall from New York City?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he was there&mdash;how long did he stay?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He stayed there until about February of 1954.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And then he did what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Then he went to California.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he working?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; he went to visit my brother for holidays. We
always tried to go to California instead of going to Miami, to be with my
brother. And he liked it so much, and we wanted so much to move to California.
So we thought if he goes there, maybe he can locate something while I
finish my contract. My contract was expiring in the spring of 1954.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your contract with Nardis?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; then I would go there, also, also in the late
spring or early summer&mdash;maybe he can locate something in the meanwhile, in
California.</p>

<p>And then I was very lucky. It was Mr. Gold's tough luck. But it was good
luck for me, because he was indicted for taxes. There was a tremendous scandal.
And he had two buildings&mdash;he lost one of the buildings. In other words,
he could not afford even to go into the suit operation, and go ahead with it.
So he was very glad that I asked for release, and he was glad to give it to me.
He thought I am going to demand money and everything, because he wants
to drop the contract before. And I was very glad. It worked out very nice
for me. We remained good friends. And then I went to California.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you work in California?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I worked with Style Garments, a coat and suit
firm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that the name of it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Style Garments. They are out of business now.
The owners were interested in real estate. And they went into real estate. So
the firm closed up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long did you remain in California?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Actually living in one spot&mdash;that was 1954. I
think it was 1955, spring, I received an offer from Dallas, to fly just for 2 or
3 weeks, and design a collection of suits. It was for I. Clark. That was wonderful.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That took you back to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. On and off. I just went for a few weeks. You see,
I designed a suit collection, and I went back. And then they asked me to
come over and do some more dresses. So I started to go there back and
forth. And also, at the same time, going to New York to buy fabrics for
the firm, and at the same time I decided, well, if I do that, I might do the
same type of work in New York. If I can fly to New York to buy fabrics,
I can design in a few weeks, and make a few thousand dollars.</p>

<p>I designed a collection for Handmacher. I designed a collection for Leeds.
One week I got $1,100. So you can see what can happen.</p>

<p>But that really was getting me. Because it went on until 1956 fall. I was
on the plane more than off the plane. And it wasn't very good for my daughter.
She was already 14, 15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had custody of your daughter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In the divorce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you taking your daughter on these trips?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Oh, no; how could I? She was going to school
all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was she going to school in California?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; going to high school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Eventually, did you take up permanent residence in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I took up permanent residence at the time when
I told my husband I am going to divorce him, and that was early fall of 1956.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you went to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I went to Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you take your daughter with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was then what age?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She was 15. And I have a reason for doing that,
because I just couldn't do it to her father. He would be completely killed.
The only thing left&mdash;he doesn't have any relatives at all. He doesn't have a
single soul in this world. In fact, I tell you&mdash;in the divorce case, I insisted
that he will have custody, so by giving her money, he will have money to live on,
too.</p>

<p>If I took the daughter, I could not give him money to live on&mdash;he wouldn't
take it. But if he had custody of the child then she will be provided for,
and he could still keep on going with that.</p>

<p>So that was the thing. But it worked out the other way&mdash;when he completely
turned in rage. He even, when I flew to California he wouldn't let
me see her. I had to get a sheriff to see her. Now, I understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He is in a mental institution in California now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. He was, on and off, and finally he is there.
He seems to be incurable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, when did you meet your present husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. 1956.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you came back to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. To design a collection. I was working there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did his daughter as well as your daughter join you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She did, but later on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She joined us in, I think, the spring of 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I had both girls for a while. You know, she eloped,
his little girl.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And married Gary Taylor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; and I wanted to break that marriage right
away, and get her back in school, and spank her&mdash;really tough. But the parents
of the boy said give the kids a chance and this and that. It was no love&mdash;it
was just delinquency. She didn't know who I was. She thought I will be
easy going&mdash;knowing her father, she thought I was easy going. And all of a
sudden she came in. She had to study, she had to be home at a certain time,
every boy she is out with I have to meet first. So she couldn't possibly&mdash;I talked
to her just last year. I said, "Tell me frankly, you wanted to live with us, and
you thought I would be very easy. And you certainly didn't like the way I
was strict with you."</p>

<p>But I was strict with my daughter, also. And she was older than she was.
And she would not go out until she brought the young man to introduce. And
then she asked us, and she was very respectful to my present husband.</p>

<p>She asked, "What do you think of him?"</p>

<p>She was 19 already. That little kid was just 14 or 15. So I could not possibly
give her more leeway than to my daughter, who was so much older.</p>

<p>Sometimes I think maybe if I wasn't so strict with her, maybe&mdash;you never
know with children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, now, Mr. De Mohrenschildt's daughter, Alexandra, is now
married.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She is divorced.</p>

<p>Can you imagine that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She has remarried.</p>

<p>Tell me about your present husband. What kind of a person is he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I tell you. He is a terrific person, absolutely
terrific. He has a soul of gold. I really mean it. And sometimes he drives
me so crazy, I can just smash his head, because he is so impatient. He is
extremely impatient. He is always in a hurry. You have to be 10 times faster
than he is in order to have everything quiet. That is about the only quality
that I would not like&mdash;he is just always in a hurry. He is always rushing
somewhere, and everything has to be just immediately. Never a second late.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is he an outspoken person?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Oh, yes; very, very, very outspoken person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Very handsome and an attractive man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I tell you. I like&mdash;inside&mdash;I think he is much
better inside than outside. He is a good-looking man. And women find him
fantastically attractive. I don't. I like his personality. I think he is wonderful.
He feels&mdash;he is nice with people, he is nice with animals. I don't think
he can ever hurt anybody or do deliberate harm.</p>

<p>He can do a lot of harm by saying something without thinking, and actually
hurt a person's feelings without realizing what he says may hurt them. He
may do that.</p>

<p>But he would never do anything deliberately to hurt anyone. So by speaking
like that&mdash;for instance, he can make a joke about a person, really unintentional,
and that joke might hurt a person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He is a little heavy in his humor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; sometimes it is uncalled for at all.</p>

<p>And, later on, when I tell him, he agrees with me. But it was already said.
And especially when you hurt little people, they get awfully hurt. And he
has that habit of sort of teasing people, or ribbing people, which some people
appreciate and some people don't.</p>

<p>I personally don't appreciate teasing, and I don't appreciate&mdash;I don't think
it is necessary. He thinks it is very funny. I don't think it is funny at all.
That is the thing. Through that, I am sure he has a couple of people that
don't like him very well. I don't think they hate him. The only one that is
really not fond of him is his ex-wife, because of the children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Didi?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. She was so hateful, that nothing could just
soften her or break her down&mdash;nothing, nothing, nothing. No matter how he
tried, no matter how I tried, nothing. It is a blank wall. Such hatred, such
venom and such hatred. It is impossible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is why it is so wonderful when he told me
that she spoke nicely about him. It was a wonderful surprise. It is for the
first time, really. It was a very pleasant surprise. So we have hope&mdash;maybe
she is growing up. You don't have to be grown up to grow up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What are your husband's political views? Now, I mean political
with a capital P. I don't mean Democrat or Republican politics. I mean
political in the grand sense.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In the grand sense&mdash;I would say he is a real Democrat,
for democracy. But, also, you see, both of us&mdash;we don't believe that every
country should have the same government, because each country&mdash;a certain
government will be good for one country, and would be completely awful for
another.</p>

<p>For instance, we even don't believe in dictators, but certain countries may
need that. They may live better, happier, until they grow up a little more to
handle themselves. So we don't&mdash;I would say we are very, very flexible on
this point, both of us&mdash;very flexible. It just depends what is the best for the
people. If people are ready and able to have a complete democracy, that is
the most wonderful government in the world. But it cannot be applied like a
slide rule to every country right off, because some countries get lost&mdash;they still
have to be guided.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you regard him as a loyal American?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Absolutely. He doesn't have to be here. He has
friends all over the world. And&mdash;we live out more than in. Why do we
come back? What is the reason? Just because we like it.</p>

<p>Gradually we hope we are going to live in a different part of the United
States. We are aiming for the San Francisco area, northern California. That
is where we would love. We love swimming, the ocean. That is the reason we
don't have a home of our own, and we don't want to build one, because when
we want a home, we are going to do it ourselves, in the place we want to. Not
just to hop around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you mind returning at 9 tomorrow morning?</p>

<hr />
<h2>TESTIMONY OF JEANNE DE MOHRENSCHILDT RESUMED</h2>

<p>The testimony of Jeanne De Mohrenschildt was taken at 9 a.m., on April 24,
1964, at 200 Maryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C., by Mr. Albert E. Jenner,
Jr., assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You worked for Judy Bond, Inc.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, Judy Bond, and Nancy Greer, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The same firm?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. I worked simultaneously, held two jobs at
the same time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It was in 1957; fall. That is when I returned. I
couldn't get anything with my coat and suit people. I switched to dresses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is the name Jack Rothenberg familiar to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't remember the people at Judy Bond. Could
be one of them, maybe. Maybe he was with Greer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The records reflect that you were employed there as a designer
in the fall of 1957.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Maybe it was with Nancy Greer. There were two&mdash;Mr.
Littman, and another one, was another fellow, his partner. Maybe that is
him. I don't remember the names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall working for Handmacher Vogel in 1956?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. You remember when I told you I flew in and
designed a collection for him? And at the same time for Leeds Limited. The
same year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Leeds Coats, Inc.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Also 1956, wasn't it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It wasn't 1956. It was 1957. No. Leeds was 1956.
Judy Bond was 1957, and Nancy Greer was 1957. You are right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then you worked for Martins in 1942, 1944, and 1945, and in the
fall of 1946?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, you cannot call it exactly working. You see,
we have in New York, they celebrate Jewish holidays, 3 days. And instead
of staying home, I went and I worked in retail store, which happens to be
Martins.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Martins Fashion Apparel Store?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; it was a store in Brooklyn. I knew buyers
very well. And it gave me a good outlook of what actually people want, on the
floor. That was the general idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. I just want to be sure about the time. 1942, 1944,
and 1945.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It sounds more or less correct. But I don't remember
for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the fall of 1946. Then you worked for a while for R.&nbsp;H.
Macy.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Just on the same basis&mdash;just for a couple of days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is all right. I just want to know that you did.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About when was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't remember. It must be before 1947, because
when I switched to my next firm, I didn't do it any more. I just couldn't
combine it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Way back in 1941 you worked for a while for Bloom and Eagen.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right, a dress firm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Can you remember about when that was? You worked there as
a model?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That was before I even started with Leeds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You worked there as a model.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Lombardy Coat Co.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I believe it was one of my very first ones. I don't
remember which one was first. Just a very, very, short time, a couple of
months. I remember I worked for Lombardy when Pearl Harbor happened.
That was December 7. I will never forget it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your employment in Dallas <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. 1953.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I should take it chronologically. What was the company for
which you worked in 1953?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Nardis; Nardis of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that spanned about what period of time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That spanned almost a year, starting summer 1953.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think I terminated the contract around April.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Around April of 1954?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; approximately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then you worked for whom?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. From then on, I moved to California, and I started
to work for Style Garment, Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That would be 1954?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That was 1954, and I think it lasted not too long,
just until Christmas. And then I had nothing at all until I had an offer from
Clark in the spring of 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That was my first job with Clark, because I worked
for Nardis before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you worked for Clark for how long?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. For Clark, on and off almost until our trip, our
walking trip to Central America. I worked with them until 1960.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was in 1960?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. 1960.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then you had your walking trip throughout the spring and summer
and fall of 1960?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; it was just fall. We started October 6. We left
Dallas on October 6 or October 5.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1960?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. 1960.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you returned when?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. And we returned to Dallas fantastically close to
the same date&mdash;in the very first days of October. I worked for another company
for one season, 6 months, Justin McCarthy, before our trip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Spring or fall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That was summer, just before we went on our trip.
I believe it was June, July, and August, September, maybe too. 1960. I worked
almost until the last day before we left on our trip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you got back in 1961. Then did you return to work when
you got back?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I didn't, because we thought we are going to
go back to Haiti in 6 weeks. The contract that my husband was negotiating was
supposed to materialize within 6 weeks. And I was stupid enough to talk about
it, tell everybody. So, naturally, I could not take the job for a short time,
because designing you are involved. You start and cannot drop it. And then it
was dragging and dragging and dragging, and actually took a year instead of
6 weeks to materialize the whole thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But it did eventually materialize?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; fortunately it did. Because I was badly hurt
by it, and so was he, because everybody knew he is going to go off on this, and
he couldn't do very much, either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">And&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. For me it was really drastic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you went to work&mdash;you did return to work before you went
to Haiti?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; but a short time. I just did it because we
needed to do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Millinery. I was working in the millinery department,
Sanger and Harris, Preston Center, Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Preston Center?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; Preston Center Store.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you worked in the millinery department until just <span class="locked">before&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Before we left for the east, before we made a trip
east. And we left 19 April. We drove off from Dallas. Nineteenth of April we
left Dallas. Instead of staying a week or 10 days as we planned, because George
had so much trouble with his little girl, and then he was also in Washington.</p>

<p>We returned almost at the last days of May. I had 2 days to pack the whole
house, and store the furniture, and separate the clothes, and God knows&mdash;we
almost went crazy, you know. We did it all in 2 days. And then we drove back
to Miami, because we had to ship a car. Grace Line wasn't going to Haiti any
more. So we drove to Miami, and we flew over, and our car came over later on,
on a boat, with our clothes, with everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From the time you left for Haiti from Miami, which, I think, was
on the second of <span class="locked">June&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. We arrived 2 June. Oh, yes; that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 2 June 1963, have you been back to the United States other than
this trip you have now made to testify?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; we have been a couple of days in San Juan
about 10 days ago. That is as close as we came to the United States. In fact,
we didn't leave the country at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That applies to your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; absolutely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall the period of time when your present husband was
on a mission for the International Cooperation Administration in Yugoslavia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you join him there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I joined him there. I forgot exactly the date.
Right after my collection was opened, right after I finished designing&mdash;I joined
him&mdash;it was supposed to be only 6 weeks, it was my vacation. But within this
time these letters were sent out by my husband. I had a telegram something
happened, a very mild excuse, and they have somebody else. Of course, when I
returned, I went back with this firm again. But at that particular time I lost
the job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You joined him in Yugoslavia. What town was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Zagreb.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were with him in Zagreb how long?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't remember exactly, but maybe a week or 10
days. It wasn't very long. He was switched from one area to another. He
worked for one company, then he was switched to another company. And then
we went to the seashore, which is exactly what we wanted. It was Petrovaz, a
little town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he remained there, and you remained there how long?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In Petrovaz?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think it was a few weeks or so. Then he had
time for a vacation, and we moved a little north, to Milicher. That was an
old king's palace converted into a hotel. Did he tell you they had been shooting
at us in Yugoslavia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you were at the shore? Yes; he said something about
that. But I would like to have you tell me about it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, we don't like public beaches. We like to be
by ourselves, and we like real wild nature&mdash;nothing that already will be prepared
for us. So we took&mdash;in the morning we took a walk in the mountains. We
climbed the mountains.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we took a canoe and just rowed along the coast. And it
was beautiful, an absolutely beautiful coast&mdash;the most beautiful spot in the
world. And the mountains&mdash;we saw something that looked like a fortification.
I noticed a ladder standing there. So we were rowing and pointing
to it. And all of a sudden we hear shots. We thought it was old fortifications
from Italian time, or whatever they were. But they were actually their fortifications
and they thought we were interested in it. They were pointing a rifle
at us and shooting, and just doing this, go away further. And we had to really
go very far out in the sea.</p>

<p>He didn't want to. He said, "At least if they shoot at us, I want to do something
to them&mdash;this way we are just lost at sea. Nobody would know a single
thing happened to us." He didn't want to row out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who is obnoxious?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. My husband. I said that is silly, I don't want to
be shot like a chicken. Go out to the sea and we will go back to the shore. I
want to make a complaint. And we rowed out. He rowed out&mdash;his bottom
was raw beefsteak, on the slippery boards of the boat. The current was
very strong, against us, and all the way out in the sea it was very difficult.</p>

<p>So when we came back he talked to some people over there. They said, "They
shoot at us, too. If accidentally you wander too close to Brioni, the villa where
Tito lives&mdash;they shoot at us, too." That wasn't enough. We went another
day again, and we started rowing around, and we saw a little island. We left
the canoe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Canoe or rowboat?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. This was a canoe. The first time was a rowboat.
So we were swimming and all of a sudden he took my photograph in front
of a beautiful cave, and I was taking his photograph standing in the water in
front of another cave. It was beautiful&mdash;just like a curtain drape. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
all of a sudden, boom, the cannon shot, about a yard from me in the water.
So, of course, we went right under the water in the cave and we were sitting
there&mdash;what are we going to do? We are quite far, an hour or so from our
hotel in a canoe. We thought, well, they shot at us, they probably think something,
they are going to come and talk with us. So we are sitting there waiting
for them to come to talk to us, but nobody came.</p>

<p>So we sat for a couple of hours. Finally, we got disgusted. So we dived in,
swam a little, behind the rocks, we got out on the seashore. Somebody gave
us a ride back to the hotel. And this time he really got angry. He made
complaint to the government, and some of their officials came over to discuss
it, and said that was just unintentional, it was another accident. The little
island we thought was completely empty, not a soul on it, they had fortification
on that island. So that is what happened to us in Yugoslavia.</p>

<p>When George told me the American people thought he was making sketches
of something, I said I can understand the Yugoslavs thinking such things, but
I said I couldn't understand about the United States Government.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, they don't know at the time. They just see somebody
doing some sketching.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; just like in Haiti, every day&mdash;he went for a
walk in the mountains, sometimes with me, sometimes with Nero.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Nero is one of your pups?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; he is the one that made the trip. So, of
course, Haitians&mdash;they almost called him Longaron&mdash;that is a werewolf, Lougrow.
So that could get him in trouble, too. But Haitians are very mild people.
They just enjoyed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you leave Europe on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. When&mdash;1957?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I cannot tell you exactly. But it was in the fall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you both return to the United States together?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Oh, no; he stayed there for quite a while. He
stayed there much longer. He returned in November, because I remember
right after he returned Clark was in New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is I. Clark?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. And in fact he went with me to meet him at the
airport, and we talked and talked and talked, and they talked me into going
back to Texas, which I wanted anyway. So then we returned together to
Texas. We went to visit his brother first, in Dartmouth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At Hanover, N.H.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; and then we drove slowly&mdash;we drove through
Florida, because I had never been in Florida, never saw it&mdash;St. Augustine. We
have a convertible car always, so we like to drive close to the sea, so we can
stop and bait. And then through Pensacola, through New Orleans. We stopped
in New Orleans, with his old, old friends, the Crumps, but they are dead now,
I believe. They have tremendous gardenia gardens there. We arrived Thanksgiving
Day at Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of what year?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It was 1957; still 1957.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, do you recall your husband making a trip to Ghana?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; he did. I believe it was in 1958, in late spring.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">And&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Not for long. It was about 3 weeks or so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was for what purpose? What did you understand it to
be for?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, to make&mdash;he was working for some people,
for the company, to find out if there is any possibilities for oil, and he made
some reports. In fact, his reports were printed even in the National Geographic.
He did very good research. And the things he said now came true.
They discovered a tremendous amount of oil in Nigeria.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Nigeria and Ghana, are they the same?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. They are not the same, but they are close. He was
in Ghana, Togoland, and Nigeria. You see, you can trace the lines throughout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
the whole world by the formations. It is a fascinating business. If it wouldn't
be too late for me, I would switch to that now. It is a fantastic business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is fantastic?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. If you love nature. Otherwise, it is no fun at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In fact, I try to help him whenever I can. I draw
maps. Just now I made for him some maps in the Dominican Republic about
this nickel mine and everything. He couldn't have it photostated. They were
too old. So I sit down and draw it any time I can, because I really love that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us without too much elaboration particularly about your
trip down through Mexico and Central America.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I tell you, it is a trip I will never forget, as
long as we live. And I don't think we ever had a more exciting, wonderful time,
in spite that we almost died a few times, and in spite that some days it was so
difficult that we were walking almost like in a daze, because we didn't know
what will happen to us.</p>

<p>Of course, we could endure a trip like that because we had a tragedy with
George's little boy. So we didn't care what will happen to us&mdash;we get killed
or not killed&mdash;the only thing we worry about Nero being an orphan if something
happen to us.</p>

<p>But it was absolutely fantastic, because we walked through little trails, old
Camino Reales, old Spanish trails. And they planned it so well, at the end
of each day we always found water. We never carried water, because the
poor mule was already overloaded. We always took water supply in the afternoon.
And we also tried to buy his corn in the afternoon, his dinner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The mule?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; it is just for him like gasoline, the corn.
Like high octane gas. And it took us about 5½ months through Mexico. Then
it was Guatemala, Salvador. It really was very interesting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Costa Rica?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Not yet. After Salvador, we were trying to cross
by boat directly to Nicaragua, because we didn't want to make that horrible
big corner in Honduras, but we couldn't. So we had to go through Honduras
and then Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama. And then we were planning to spend
another year and go all the way to Chile. And we would. We were so tough
by then, nothing could hurt us. We were thin like rails. And George has
never been that thin in his life. He was in good physical shape. But the
torrential rains&mdash;we were almost swept out a couple of times. And we would
have to wait 6 months in Panama in order to proceed. We couldn't take that
much time from our life, from our work. So I talked him into going to Haiti.
He was going to return to Dallas. And I didn't want to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Before you get to Haiti&mdash;was that purely a business trip&mdash;I
mean a pleasure trip?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It was pleasure trip plus he collected a lot of minerals
on the way. And he sent them&mdash;he had been sending them to be safe.
And they were all lost. A tremendous amount of minerals. We found mercury,
such perfection of samples that you never could see such perfect crystallization.
And they are all gone, all lost.</p>

<p>But we do have the names and addresses of people and villages where we have
it, and then we discovered some pyramids which, when we have time to take off,
we are going, of course, to fly there and work on it, because it is fascinating.
We couldn't take much time for anything, because we only had 6 months' visa
through Mexico.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your visa in Mexico permitted you to stay there 6 months?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. A tourist visa, 6 months. We were up on the border&mdash;that
means we have to fly to Mexico City to extend it, it would be too
much trouble. We were sort of in a hurry.</p>

<p>But in Guatemala we were rewarded for the whole trip. There was a volcano
erupting. Hakaia, and it was absolutely fantastic. Can you imagine what is
an erupting volcano? I was dreaming about that since I was this big, that
I want to see a volcano, I want to look in the crater. So we climbed every
volcano. And this one was erupting. The lava was gushing down. We have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
photographs and movies. I am from the red lava a yard away, just burning.
And poor little Nero&mdash;my hair is standing on my head from the heat. It was
a fascinating sight. Then we walked in lava, and it was all smoking like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, was there any consideration other than you have indicated,
any purpose&mdash;I will put it that way&mdash;of your trip other than you have indicated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did it have any connection with any government, any agency,
or any government?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Not at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or have any political aspects whatsoever?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I know you have to ask these questions, but there
was none at all, absolutely none.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, while you were making your trip down through Mexico
and the Central American countries, the Bay of Pigs invasion occurred, did
it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. But we learned about it much later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. Were you aware of the Bay of Pigs invasion in
advance?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Advance? We were not even aware at the time of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No. But we noticed something very funny. We
noticed some young people running around with little tiny hats. They looked
like American boys. And then when we&mdash;we <span class="locked">had&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In Guatemala City. We have all our mail always
sent to the American Embassy, in each country, and then as we arrived, asked
them to hold it. They have been wonderful about it. So the minute we arrived
to the city&mdash;we leave our mule and go right away to the Embassy to pick up
our mail. And it was very funny. There was such a commotion, such confusion
in the American Embassy, we just remarked about it. They were running
around, busy, busy. I forgot the name of the American consul. He was on the
phone all the time, such a confusion was going on.</p>

<p>So we noticed that. And we noticed those funny looking boys running around.
I thought they were Canadian boys. And later on we learned that there was
an invasion.</p>

<p>So maybe that was the people that were involved in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is all you know about the Bay of Pigs invasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is all we know about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you ever been in Cuba?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There was an occasion, was there not, when your husband and
you were in Mexico that there was a Russian mission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Mikoyan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That was exactly the time when Alexandra eloped.
We were two weeks in Mexico City. George was on business. And there was
also a Russian exhibit which we missed in New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Do you have a date when she eloped&mdash;sometime
in November.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What year?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I am trying to get to the year now. 1959 must be.
I think it was 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Wait a minute.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I believe it was November 1959, to my best belief.
I cannot be sure.</p>

<p>Chronologically, it must be around there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You tell me about the incident and I will find the date.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It was very simple. We had dinner with the
presidential pilot and some other friends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is the pilot of the President of Mexico?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. Captain Gordunio Nounio. I can't spell the
name. Can we just say presidential pilot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whenever you say anything, it gets on the record. Now, you
have to tell us how to spell it. Spell it phonetically, as you understand it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. G-o-r-d-u-n-i-o N-o-u-n-i-o.</p>

<p>They were giving him&mdash;the Mexicans were giving him a big farewell reception
sort of party at the airport. And, of course, it was guarded, and nobody could
get in there. He said, would you like to see Mikoyan? I said, of course I would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who said that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. The pilot.</p>

<p>I said, of course, we would like to see him. It would be a lot of fun to see
somebody from real Russia, not just the immigrants. So then George wanted
to go, too, to start with. And I said, "You better don't go, because it will be
misinterpreted, it can be misinterpreted. If I go, they know very well I cannot
do any harm, but if you go it may hurt you businesswise." People in Texas are
very narrow-minded.</p>

<p>So I went in the morning. He picked me up at the hotel. We went to that
reception. I did it out of sheer curiosity. I wanted to see the crowd, I wanted
to see the people, I was looking at women. It was, of course, pathetic. Women
don't even look like women.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who are you talking about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. The Russian women, at the reception. The Russians
are supposed to be good-looking people. They were not even good looking.
There was only one man that was good looking. He was in some kind of uniform.
I don't know what his rank or what it is, because I don't know the uniforms.
There was only one handsome man in the whole tremendous crowd. And
then we went all the way to the plane. I was with the captain, and he was
very close&mdash;very good friend of Mikoyan. We came over. I didn't say one
word in Russian all the time, I was speaking English. And then we came over
to the plane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You went out to the airport?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. To the airport, when he was already leaving, after
making all the speeches and everything. We went with the captain to say goodbye
to Mikoyan, at the plane. They had the Russian plane standing there, the
cameras, TV's. And he introduced me to Mikoyan, this is my friend Señora
De Mohrenschildt. And I take his hand and <span class="locked">said&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You spoke in Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, I told him in Russian, how are you, Tovarish
Mikoyan. And he was so shocked, because I didn't look like a Russian, I looked
like a fashion plate, and spoke English all the time. And all of a sudden, I
deliberately&mdash;it was sort of a prank. He almost fainted. It was fantastic. I
didn't make any secrets. I told about it in Dallas to everybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, that was purely an adventure?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Oh, sure. It was just a prank, just for fun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. You had no prior association with Mr. Mikoyan, or any
member of the Russian mission when you went to Mexico&mdash;you had not anticipated
the presence of the Russian mission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. We didn't know that they were there, absolutely.
George went on his business. It just happened to be that they had this exhibit
there, and it happens to be that Mikoyan was there&mdash;I think they were offering
a lot of money to the Mexican Government, and the Mexican Government refused
it. They didn't take it. But they have been on friendly terms, they didn't
quarrel about it&mdash;they just didn't accept it, they didn't accept his proposal.</p>

<p>And we happened to know about it because we had this friend, the presidential
pilot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. All right. We have obtained, either from you or from
your husband, the marriage date of Alexandra.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That must be November 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That happened within those 2 weeks we were in
Mexico City.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You went from Panama to Haiti?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. We were trying to go by boat. We went to
Colon, to get the boat. There was no boat. So we had to fly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You flew to Haiti?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the purpose of that visit to Haiti?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. The main purpose was to rest, and another purpose
was to see a very, very old friend of my husband's father, 75-year-old man that
according to his letters to George, he loved him like a son, and he had the
same feelings to me. So I told George, if we don't go now, we might never see
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was his name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Michael Breitman. And he died within the next
year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But that was&mdash;that visit to Haiti at that time was to visit this
gentleman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. And to rest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From your long, arduous trip through Central America?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You then returned to the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By boat?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. By boat, by Lykes Line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your harbor was what&mdash;St. Charles, or Lake Charles?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think it is Lake Charles. They changed in the
last month. They never know which port. We were met by friends over there,
the Savages.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the Mitchells?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. And we crossed straight to their house, stayed
with them a few days. Then a friend of ours loaned us a car and we drove to
Dallas. And then he came over and picked up the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your <span class="locked">friend&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. From Houston. We have quite a few friends in
Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I am going to, in a moment, bring you to the period when
you met the Oswalds.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But I want you to tell me first, if you will, slowly, the nature of
the Russian colony in Dallas at that time.</p>

<p>Now, as I understand it, you met the Oswalds in the summer of 1962.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In the late summer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There was a small Russian colony?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. You see, I wouldn't classify it as a colony. There
are some odds-and-ends Russian people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am using a reference to identify a more or less heterogeneous
group of people in Dallas who had a measure of common interests arising out
of the fact that either they or their parents had been born or had a relatively
immediate contact with Russia.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, you see, there are two types of Russian people
there&mdash;some that came in after the revolution, and there are some new ones
that escaped during the Second World War, from Germany.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are now telling me about this situation in Dallas, are you
not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I am trying to classify who was before and who
came in later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you are telling me about people in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. From what I know, the latest arrivals to the United
States was, of course&mdash;Marina was, and I think there was another one, Declan
Ford.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Declan Ford?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. She was on What's My Life, or something, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
dramatic story. She married an American boy, and he rescued her, and so on
and so forth. They came over and lived in Dallas. His name was Skotnicki,
and then they divorced. I think he was Polish. He was a nice fellow, but he
was too anxious to make too much money, so the marriage broke up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There were at this time in Dallas some people of Russian derivation.
Some had come directly from Russia&mdash;that is, in the sense that they
were caught up in the vortex of the Second World War.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The Germans invaded Russia. They were prisoners, civil
prisoners.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Her story is something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Taken by the Germans and brought to Germany, and when the
war ended, they met American boys, and married them.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; but that is the only one I know. I don't know
of anybody else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then others had escaped Russia or Poland?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. For instance, one of them&mdash;she was never even
in Russia&mdash;that type of Russian colony. She was married to an American man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, this is a group that had common interests&mdash;interested in
each other?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Of course, they all
criticize each other. Some people were closer, some people were further apart.
They were not exactly all friends&mdash;I will put it that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Let's see&mdash;you had been there&mdash;well, you were off and on commencing
in 1953, and then relatively permanently commencing in 1957.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. 1956, 1957.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, as people came to Dallas, that is persons with this history,
did you people&mdash;and I don't mean just you alone, but I am talking about the
whole group&mdash;become interested in them, seek to meet them, become acquainted?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, if anybody heard that there was all of a
sudden a new Russian somewhere, there was, naturally, interest in people to
know who they are, where they are from, what kind of people they are. And,
of course, if they were destitute or something&mdash;and none of them were really&mdash;only
Marina was&mdash;then we helped them.</p>

<p>But there were no organizations, no particular organizations to help or wait
for them to come in, because there was no necessity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, were you generally&mdash;were you advised normally in advance
that somebody new was coming?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No. In fact, they were talking about Marina for
months to us. I said, after all, we should really meet that young girl. They
were talking for a couple of months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, we found out about her actually through, I
believe, George Bouhe. I think George probably told you the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What about Max Clark?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Max Clark, too, because they lived in Fort Worth.
Max Clark and Gali Clark. And actually George Bouhe was very active. He is
an old busybody, and he loves to do things, charity things. He is the one that
organizes things like that. So he said he even had a fund for them&mdash;the people
would give money&mdash;because he gave money to pay for her teeth, you know,
everything that was necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Bouhe did give you <span class="locked">money&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. To pay for her dentist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And do you remember how much that was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Oh, it wasn't very much&mdash;maybe $20; something like
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you receive, also, some money from George Bouhe for anything
else with respect to the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I take it from what you have said, that you were wholly
unadvised, you and your husband, that Marina and Lee were coming to the Fort
Worth-Dallas area before they came. You knew nothing about it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Nothing at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't even know when they came.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you heard anything about them at all, that he had been in
Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Before, and then had married her, and come back, he attempted
to defect?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; nothing at all&mdash;in spite that it was in some
press somewhere&mdash;I believe it was printed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you didn't see it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Never saw it. Never had no idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had there been any discussion among you people, any of you&mdash;Bouhe,
Clark, and Meller, Voshinins, Mamantov, Gravitis, Dymitruk, <span class="locked">Raigorodsky&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is a character&mdash;Dymitruk was also imported
recently. I think after we were there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What do you mean imported?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I mean he arrived&mdash;I call him imported. He was
really a sad sack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was the husband of Lydia Dymitruk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will ask you about her.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. But I know very little about them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It may be important to us that you don't. But the part I want
to emphasize here is&mdash;if it is the truth&mdash;I don't want to put any words in your
mouth&mdash;that you had no advance notice that either of these people were coming,
and you knew nothing whatsoever about them, never heard anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Absolutely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was that generally true of all these people?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. From what we know; yes. I don't think anybody
knew anything at all. All of a sudden they arrived on the horizon. And,
actually, who discovered them for the first time, I don't even know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I cannot even tell. I would like to know, myself,
now, how it came about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They were brought to your attention?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your recollection is it was George Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. My recollection is that he finally&mdash;we were sort of
ashamed of ourselves that we still didn't meet her, and we still didn't do anything,
you know, for that girl. So, finally&mdash;I don't remember how, but either we
drove, or whether they brought her to us for the first time. That is how it
happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this was in the late summer of 1962?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. And I told him, Bouhe, at that particular
time, we were financially not very well off, and I could not contribute any money,
but I had time and a car, and I could take the baby to the clinic, and I could
take her with her teeth, and anything of that sort I would be glad to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We might digress a moment. In the summer of 1962 you and
your husband were not as financially affluent as you had been?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, we were draining pretty well, because for a
year we didn't make any money, on our trip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am not criticizing. All I am doing is seeking the facts.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Not enough to be charitable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By the way, your husband, he is a fine geologist and petroleum
engineer. He is not a man who likes to concentrate on business, finances, is he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I would say he is pretty good with money. I
am the one&mdash;I made money too easily, so I squandered money. He doesn't. But
you see I always had a steady income. He doesn't have a steady income. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
has an assignment for 2 or 3 weeks, he has very good money for it, and then we
never know when it is going to come in.</p>

<p>He may have within a year two or three fantastic things&mdash;go to Ghana, go
somewhere else, and he makes quite a lot of money.</p>

<p>But then maybe a year that he has nothing at all coming in. So he learned
when he has something to hold onto it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So there were periods when his financial situation was good, so
he was high?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. That is how we took our trip, because we
were very fortunate before our trip&mdash;he had an assignment in Ghana, and he
made some money, and I was making very good money, so we thought we can
afford it. Besides he almost lost his mind. We had to go on that trip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then there were valleys, financially, in which you were not as
affluent?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you folks were at no time wealthy people?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Real wealthy, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You <span class="locked">made&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I could have been if I saved the money, but I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You made a comfortable living, and that is about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But at this particular time, you were not in a position to assist
the Oswalds financially in any material sense?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Exactly; none at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you were in a position that you could afford them time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And attention?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. Not them&mdash;actually with Marina, because we
couldn't do much for Oswald&mdash;just talk to a couple of people about him, and
maybe get him a job. But even the job he had&mdash;I don't know who got it&mdash;I think
it was an agency that got him the job he had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At Leslie Welding?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't know the name of the firm. He worked in
a darkroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was later.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't even know the name of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are not clear in your mind, I take it, that when you first met
the Oswalds; you don't know whether you went to their home <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't remember. I really don't remember. And,
believe me, I had enough time to think about it. I was trying to remember
every little detail that can be useful. I cannot still remember exactly how it
came about&mdash;whether they were brought to our house. I don't think we drove
and got them for the first time. Maybe we took them back, you know, to Fort
Worth. It could be. I don't know.</p>

<p>Of course, they had the baby with them. They always had to bring the baby&mdash;couldn't
leave the baby with anyone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But in due course you did enter their home in Fort Worth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I never entered their home in Fort Worth. George,
I think, did once. George walked in, because Lee was asleep, I think, when we
brought Marina&mdash;so he maybe walked in the house&mdash;because he went out to the
door. I never did. They lived somewhere&mdash;there was a tremendous store,
Montgomery Ward or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Sears?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I think it was Montgomery Ward. I don't remember.
That is where they lived. It was a miserable-looking house. That is
what I saw. A wooden building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You found them to be in destitute circumstances, did you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I wouldn't say they were completely starving,
but they were quite miserable&mdash;quite, quite miserable, you know. Even if they
were not destitute, the personality that Lee had would make anybody miserable
to live with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Tell us about Lee Oswald.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. What I think of the fellow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your impressions of him, what you thought of him.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Disagreeable. He was very, very disagreeable,
and disappointed. He is like a puppy dog that everybody kicked. And he was
sort of withdrawn within himself. And his greatest objection was that people
helped them too much, they were showering things on Marina. Marina had a
hundred dresses given to her. The baby had a crib. My daughter didn't have
it when I came to the United States, and I didn't have one-hundredth of what
Marina had, because I didn't know anybody, and I didn't want to know anybody
when I came over. I was in such circumstances. So, anyway, he objected to
that lavish help, because Marina was throwing it into his face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Absolutely&mdash;see people, how nice they are? And she
is always telling me&mdash;the people are nice, giving all these things, and he is
insulting them for it. He was offensive with the people. And I can understand
why, and maybe I was the only one that understood him, while he was
offensive, because that hurt him. He could never give her what the people
were showering on her. So that was very difficult for him, no matter how
hard he worked&mdash;and he worked very hard. He worked overtime, he used to
come in at 11 o'clock, she said, at night, and when he come home, he started
reading again. So he was not running around.</p>

<p>He didn't drink, he didn't smoke. He was just hard working, but a very
difficult personality.</p>

<p>And usually offensive at people because people had an offensive attitude to
him.</p>

<p>I don't think he was offensive for that, because of the things we did, he could
have killed us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, you see, he mistreated his wife physically.
We saw her with a black eye once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you talk to him and to her about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; we did. I called him just like our own kids,
and set them down, and I said, "Listen, you have to grow up, you cannot live
like that. This is not a country that permits such things to happen. If you love
each other, behave. If you cannot live with each other peacefully, without all
this awful behavior, you should separate, and see, maybe you really don't love
each other."</p>

<p>Marina was, of course, afraid she will be left all alone, if she separate from
Oswald&mdash;what is she going to do? She doesn't know the language, she had nobody
to turn to. I understand they didn't get along with Oswald's family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, this is what you learned in talking with them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, yes; through them actually, by facing them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I want you to identify your sources of information.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You learned through Marina and Oswald, also, that they didn't
get along well with <span class="locked">their&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I cannot say through them, because maybe people
talked about it, you know. She couldn't live in her sister-in-law's home, they
didn't get along. And I understand that later on somebody mentioned that the
reason was that she was just too lazy. She slept in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your impression?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She is lazy. You see, there are people that actually
are no good, but still they have something very nice about them, that you cannot
really be furious with them or mad, you really can't. She is lazy, and I
know it, because she stayed once overnight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where? At your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; with the baby. And I tell you&mdash;if I stay with
somebody overnight, I will jump up the first thing in the morning, see what I can
do to help, knowing I will be doing everything.</p>

<p>She didn't. She slept. I actually had to waken her up. She did the same
thing&mdash;she stayed in our daughter's home overnight. Because when her teeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
were pulled, she was not in condition to go back. She was the same way&mdash;very
lazy. And I just couldn't understand it&mdash;a young person. Maybe she was ill.
We talked about it&mdash;maybe we have just too much energy. For a young girl
to sleep late, and not to be active.</p>

<p>The proof of her laziness is that she didn't do much about learning English,
in spite I gave her the records, and we gave her one of our little phonographs.
I had beautiful records to learn English&mdash;I bought them in New York when I
arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it that she was lazy that she didn't pursue learning English,
or did Oswald object to her learning English?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. According to her Oswald objected, and he also told
us himself that he wants to speak with her in Russian, because he doesn't want
to forget Russian.</p>

<p>But then we got onto Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me about it now.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He didn't want to forget his Russian. That was
his reason&mdash;not to let his wife learn English&mdash;because she was the only person
he could speak Russian to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He could still speak Russian to her, even though she learned
English, couldn't he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Of course, that is what we told him. We said, "You
are crippling her, she has to learn English. She cannot live in this country
without the language, she cannot do anything."</p>

<p>He was strange in many, many ways.</p>

<p>But he never appeared to be violent or anything. He was a little violent
once, when we came to the point that we said we are taking your wife and
child away. That is the only time he showed real nastiness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Please.</p>

<p>You reached the point where you and your husband took Marina and the child
out of the home and away from Oswald against his objections.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Against his objections. Actually, we talked him
into doing it peacefully.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And where did you take Marina and June?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. We took Marina and June to the house of Meller.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Anna Meller?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Anna Meller, yes. Very poor people&mdash;they put the
baby's crib right in the dining room and everything. That is how nice people
were, trying to help her. That was supposed to be temporary until we find
another place where she could live with somebody for 2 or 3 months. We were
trying to put her with Ford, with Declan Ford's wife, because she had a big
house, and she had a newborn baby. But she is not a very easygoing person.
She refused. I was furious with her that she refused, because she really could
take Marina very nicely.</p>

<p>And I believe finally she was talked into it, and she had Marina maybe for a
little while with her. I don't know. I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In October or November?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Maybe, yes. I don't even know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But why did you take Marina from the home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Because he was beating her, and we didn't think
it was right. We thought that a separation for them&mdash;they will decide whether
they really love each other, they cannot live without each other, or they forget
about each other. But that was absolutely useless to continue to live the way
they were.</p>

<p>In fact, Bouhe had the same idea, but he was afraid to do it. He was always
afraid of Lee. Naturally, being a bachelor&mdash;perhaps, Bouhe's type of person
is afraid of his own shadow&mdash;there are people like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, he is an older man.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think he saw a lot in his life, maybe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He is not a man of great physical stature, like your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is it. Lots of things contribute to the personality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, Mrs. De Mohrenschildt, you had discussions with both
Marina and Lee about their difficulties?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; we had them at the same time, in the same
room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, what were the reasons that she advanced as to any&mdash;as to
her dissatisfaction?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. What was the reasons what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What were the reasons she said why she was dissatisfied with
him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Oh, there was quite a few reasons. And I tell
you&mdash;it was strange for me to hear from a young girl like that to speak so, how
you say it&mdash;so boldy, about sex, for instance. I was shocked by it, you know&mdash;because
in my times, even I was twice as old as she.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Will you please tell me what she said?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, she said her husband doesn't satisfy her. She
just&mdash;and he is just too busy with his things, he doesn't pay enough attention
to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was one reason?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is one of the main reasons, yes.</p>

<p>And the second reason, he was cruel with her&mdash;for instance, she likes to
smoke, and he would forbid her to smoke. Any little argument or something&mdash;like
once something&mdash;she didn't fill his bathtub, he beat her for it. And, also,
he didn't like for her to have a drink of wine. She liked wine very much.
She wasn't a drunk or anything, but she likes to drink wine. And he would
object to that, too. And that was their main disagreements.</p>

<p>And then with the baby, he was absolutely fanatical about the child. He
loved that child. You should see him looking at the child, he just changed
completely. He thought that she was not too good with the child. The child
was already spoiled to no end. Every time the child makes a noise, she picked it
up. If she is not there in a second to pick the child up, Lee is after her&mdash;why
is the baby crying? And the baby is extremely difficult, because it doesn't
know anybody but her or Lee. Nobody could pick her up. And she is constantly
with her. She had the child with her all the time, from our observations.
She just couldn't take it. It was very, very difficult. And still at the
same time, she didn't do much to free herself from it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What were Marina's personal habits? Was she clean and neat?
Did she keep her home clean and neat? Or did her laziness spill over into those
areas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, it was halfway, because it seems to be neat,
and still not very&mdash;she was not a woman to arrange the home or make a home.
I don't think so. And I don't know enough about it, because they had so few
things, and they were so poor. So what can you make a home out of, nothing.
You cannot really judge. You cannot. I am sure if she has things to do it
with, I am sure she will.</p>

<p>At that particular time, she could not. She didn't have enough things to
make a home. The apartments they were living in in Dallas were miserable,
very, very poor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Give me your opinion <span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. One thing I want to tell you.</p>

<p>When they were planning to move in Dallas, from Fort Worth, when I took
her&mdash;the baby to the clinic, I was trying to find for them a little apartment
somewhere closer to us, within the same area, University Park, or somewhere,
knowing that I cannot race every time she needs something with the car to help
them.</p>

<p>Lee insisted for some particular reason to live very, very far from everybody,
from all these people. They lived in Oak Cliff&mdash;God knows where from us.
Maybe he didn't want it because he didn't want other people to put their nose in
his home. I don't think he had anything against us because we were with Marina.
But I don't think he liked very much that Bouhe was showering her with things,
and the other people give her so many things. Maybe that is why.</p>

<p>Why did he live so far?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
We were very mad about it, too.</p>

<p>I said, "For God sakes, if we are to help them, I cannot race to Oak Cliff to
help them with this or that"&mdash;if she had to go to the doctor. Why wouldn't they
take a little place near us, it will be much easier for me to help her.</p>

<p>He had some reasons to live far away.</p>

<p>I don't know if anybody else mentioned that to you. That was everybody's
impression. For some particular reason, he moved all the way out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me of her personality.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think I told you as much as I can. At the same
time, in spite she is lazy&mdash;well, it is her upbringing, that is the way she was
brought up. But she was a very, very pleasant girl. And she loved life, and she
loved the United States, absolutely. We would drive on the streets, she would
just&mdash;oh, that is the United States.</p>

<p>That is maybe why I like her, because she give me the impression she felt like
I felt when I came in. She said she was always dreaming to come to the
United States. She looked at those pictures with big, big houses and everything.</p>

<p>Did I tell you how she met Oswald, according to her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did she say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It was in the town of Minsk. There was some kind
of apartment houses, supposed to be very, very good. And she saw that house
and thought, "How wonderful if I just go there to visit in that apartment house."</p>

<p>And Lee happened to be living there. And I think Lee was sick. And she
sort of nursed him out, or something like that. That is how they met.</p>

<p>And I don't know&mdash;but it is very possible that she was very much influential
in making them come back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Come to the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Come to the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was the impression you obtained from her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, yes.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he was also disappointed. He wasn't as excited as he
was when he went over there, from the impressions we get from him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From your contacts with him, you had the impression he had
been disappointed in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I asked him, "Why did you come back, if you were
such a brave big hero and you threw the passport?"</p>

<p>And as she told me, "In the American Ambassador's face in Moscow."</p>

<p>He said, "Here is your passport, now I am going to be a Soviet citizen."</p>

<p>And I said, "How come you are back?"</p>

<p>He said, "I didn't find what I was looking for."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oswald said that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That was Oswald's answer. "I didn't find what
I was looking for."</p>

<p>So, to me, the answer was the stupid kid decided to be obnoxious, and
thinking he was a big hero went over there, and learned the hard way, burned
himself, and decided to come back, and our Government was wonderful to help
him at the time. And he was very conscientious about paying the debt, very
conscientious. He paid it back, I think, the first thing, out of the first salary,
in spite how hard it was for them to live. Those are the things.</p>

<p>And I don't know of anybody saying anything good about him. And that
made me a little mad. Nobody said anything good about him. He had a lot
of good qualities. He had a lot of terrible qualities, but certainly to compare
him with that horrible Ruby&mdash;Oswald had a lot of good qualities. And if
people would be kinder to him, maybe, you know&mdash;maybe he wouldn't be
driven to be so, and wouldn't do anything like that. I don't know whether
he did or not, anyway. But he would not be involved in it.</p>

<p>But I have the impression that he was just pushed, pushed, pushed, and she
was probably nagging, nagging, nagging.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You found her to be a nagger?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; oh, yes; she ribbed him even in front of us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She did?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She did. She ribbed him so, that if I would ever
speak to my husband that way we would not last long. I would not do it.
Because I could <span class="locked">see&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did she say? You <span class="locked">see&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Oh, big hero, or look at that big shot, something
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you say she ribbed him in front of us, that doesn't mean
anything to us. That is a conclusion.</p>

<p>What did she say to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Let me try to remember exactly. Don't forget,
I am telling right now impressions. It is very difficult to remember exact words.
But certain things led to leave that impression in my mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. De Mohrenschildt, it happens that you and George, having
the time, having the inclination, being the kind of people you are, you saw
more of the Oswalds than anybody else.</p>

<p>And what I am trying to do is to obtain from you, not only your impressions,
but how you came by them.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. But what I want to tell you&mdash;I don't think
it is correct. We didn't see them more than anybody else. In fact, we saw
them maybe less, because she never lived with us&mdash;she stayed once overnight.
And they have been very, very seldom at our house, very, very seldom. I
cannot exactly tell how many times. But you can count it on your fingers
how many times. And usually it was when finally I find the time and I said
come over and I will make dinner for you, or something like that, because I
knew they were not eating very well.</p>

<p>He didn't care for it at all, but she did. She liked to eat well, and good
things. So that was the only occasion we saw them.</p>

<p>So I think other people saw them even more. For instance, the people that
she lived with, absolutely, because he used to come and visit her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, you were more direct with her and with him, you and
your husband, because primarily his disposition is to speak his mind, and
Oswald respected your husband.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He did. He respected him, and he respected me.
And maybe that is what makes the difference with the rest of the crowd. He
never was respectful. Once, as I said, he was a little&mdash;showed a little violence,
and he said he will break all the baby's toys and tear her dresses if we take
her away from him.</p>

<p>I said, "Lee, where will that get you? If you really love Marina that is the
last thing you should do, then you lose her forever." And he sort of boiled
and boiled. He sat quietly, you know. And he said, all right, he would not
do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I asked you as to the sources of difficulty, and you related
them. Did she twit him about his inability to make enough money so that she
could live better?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. That was one complaint. Another complaint,
sexwise, he wasn't satisfactory for her. In fact, she was almost sick that
she wasn't getting enough sex, which I never heard of before, I didn't know
such things can happen to people, you know.</p>

<p>We saw, ourselves, he was a little difficult&mdash;for instance, with the baby. I
also objected that he didn't let her smoke. After all, she is supposed to be a
grown woman. He was definitely domineering&mdash;it has to be just like he said
and that is it. He always had a feeling that he is the boss, and she has to&mdash;just
nothing, just wipe the floor with her. This man. So we objected to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you were going to tell me the basis on which you formed
your opinion as to her, you say, nagging. You used the term "ribbing." This
was not jocular, was it&mdash;not joking? It was irritating?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It was irritating. That he was a big shot, reading,
reading, reading.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would say that in your presence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She would ridicule him, in other words?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes, in a way, yes. She said things that will
hurt men's pride. That definitely was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Try and recall more of that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I am trying to think what else she said. Also, she
objected violently that he was rude to the people that helped her. That was
very important. Because&mdash;and I know&mdash;I told you the reasons why he objected
to that, which are understandable, also.</p>

<p>But still, on the other hand, for instance, one incident was&mdash;I remember the
Clarks invited them for dinner, and Lee answered the phone, and he said,
when they invited him for dinner, we have other plans. He probably didn't
want to go there. That is all it was. But you don't talk like that to people.
So Marina objected to that. She told that to me.</p>

<p>There were several other occasions similar to that. For instance, he could
not stand George Bouhe. He just could not stand him. And, in a way, I don't
blame him. I can't stand him, either&mdash;that type of a person. He is okay,
he is supposed to be a friend. But I don't like that type of personality. He
absolutely could not stand him.</p>

<p>You know, some people do charity, and they expect for you to kiss their
hands for it. And some people do charity, and they are very glad to do it
and forget about it, don't expect anything. This is the kind of charity I
believe in. Bouhe likes to help, and then he keeps those people like slaves, he is
a little king, and they do anything for him after that. But Oswald didn't.</p>

<p>And that is why there was tremendous antagonism there. Bouhe asked Marina
never to come to his house at all, because he was afraid that Oswald will follow
her and will cause him a scandal, or God knows what. He was that kind of
person. I think that was the main thing, that Oswald was rude to people
helping him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Oswald ever talk about his political views in your presence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In which way? Overall political, or any particular
incidents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Politics with a capital P. His views on government.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think definitely he was a Marxist, ideologist
Marxist. I don't think he was a Communist from the way I would understand a
Communist. We didn't know if he did or he didn't belong to any party at all. I
don't think he even belonged to a party in Russia, because that was&mdash;oh, this
is very important.</p>

<p>His objection&mdash;the things that he didn't like in Russia was those horrible
meetings, constant meetings, party meetings. He said that you have to work,
and you have to go to those meetings&mdash;they drive people crazy, those party meetings,
worker meetings. They have to go and listen to speeches and bla, bla,
bla. So I don't think he was&mdash;according to that, I don't think he was interested
in a party, or belonging to anything.</p>

<p>It was a complete surprise to us when we learned after all this that he
was actually involved in doing something for Castro, selling leaflets or something,
in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Passing them out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Absolutely. Because we never <span class="locked">had&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were in Haiti by that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Oh, yes; we saw them last time Easter, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, something occurred in Easter, 1963 when you went to visit
them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was this Easter Sunday or the day after?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No, to my best recollection it was Saturday before
Easter. By the way, the first time they talked to us about it, I completely
mixed all the dates. I thought it was in the fall. But it was the day I remember
when we come over with the big pink rabbit for the baby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you arrive there during the day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; it was in the evening. I think we were playing
tennis, and then we were somewhere, and then I decided we will be busy tomorrow,
and I wanted to take the rabbit to the baby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
And we came over late at night. It was 10 o'clock, or maybe later. And
I remember they gave us something to drink.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You arrived there. Were they&mdash;had they retired for the night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think they were halfway in bed already, because
the house was dark. I remember we banged on the door. It was dark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Lee came to the door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't remember who came to the door, Marina
or Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They turned the light on. And where were they living then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That was their last apartment&mdash;not Elsbeth, but
the other one. I have the address, Elsbeth address. But the other address I
don't have. It is just around the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 214?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't know the address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it upstairs or downstairs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Upstairs. There was a little terrace, and a big
tree growing right next to the terrace.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you been there before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is the first time you had ever been there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't remember. Maybe I was. I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You got there. Now, just <span class="locked">relax&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I am trying to think hard, because every little fact
could be important.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you are excited. Relax, and tell me everything that occurred,
chronologically, as best you can on that occasion. You came to the door and
either Marina or Oswald came to the door, and you and your husband went in
the home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then, go on. Tell me about it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. And I believe from what I remember George sat
down on the sofa and started talking to Lee, and Marina was showing me the
house&mdash;that is why I said it looks like it was the first time, because why would
she show me the house if I had been there before? Then we went to another
room, and she opens the closet, and I see the gun standing there. I said, what
is the gun doing over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You <span class="locked">say&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. A rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A rifle, in the closet?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In the closet, right in the beginning. It wasn't
hidden or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Standing up on its butt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I show you Commission Exhibit 139. Is that the rifle that you
saw?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It looks very much like it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was it standing in the corner of the closet?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. You want me to show you how it was leaning? Make
believe I open the closet door this way. And the rifle was leaning something
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Right against the wall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; and the closet was square. I said, what is
this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was this rifle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't know. It looks very much like it, because
something was dangling over it, and I didn't know what it was. This telescopic
sight. Like we had a rifle with us on the road, we just had a smooth thing,
nothing attached to it. And I saw something here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I say your attention was arrested, not only, because when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
closet door was opened by Marina you saw the rifle in the closet&mdash;you saw a
rifle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That surprised you, first?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And then other things that arrested your attention, as I gather
from what you said, is that you saw a telescopic sight?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; but I didn't know what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But your attention was arrested by that fact, because it was something
new and strange to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were accustomed to your husband having weapons?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, we had only one rifle on our trip. But my
father was a collector of guns, that was his hobby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And being accustomed to rifles, to the extent you have indicated,
you noticed this telescopic lens, because you had not seen a rifle with a telescopic
lens on it before? Had you seen a rifle with the bolt action that this has?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I didn't ever know. I read it was bolt action,
but I would not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you did notice this protrusion, the ball sticking out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I don't recall. The only thing there was something
on it. It could be that it was the telescopic sight or something, but it was
something on the rifle. It was not a smooth, plain rifle. This is for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, when you saw that, and being surprised, were you concerned
about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I just asked what on earth is he doing with a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did she say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She said, "Oh, he just loves to shoot." I said,
"Where on earth does he shoot? Where can he shoot?" When they lived in a
little house. "Oh, he goes in the park and he shoots at leaves and things like
that." But it didn't strike me too funny, because I personally love skeet shooting.
I never kill anything. But I adore to shoot at a target, target shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Skeet?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I just love it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Didn't you think it was strange to have someone say he is going
in a public park and shooting leaves?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. But he was taking the baby out. He goes with her,
and that was his amusement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she say that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; that was his amusement, practicing in the park,
shooting leaves. That wasn't strange to me, because any time I go to an amusement
park I go to the rifles and start shooting. So I didn't find anything strange.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you shot a rifle at the rifle range in these amusement parks?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Little .22?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't know what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Didn't you think it was strange that a man would be walking
around a public park in Dallas with a high-powered rifle like this, shooting
leaves?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't know it was a high-powered rifle. I had
no idea. I don't even know right now. Is it a high-powered rifle? Or just a
regular one-bullet rifle, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is a one-bullet rifle, but it is a pretty powerful one.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I didn't know that. What caliber is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 6.5.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That I don't understand. We had 16&mdash;shotgun
with us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had anything been said up to this point in your acquaintance
with the Oswalds of his having had a rifle, or a shotgun, in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No discussion of any hunting in Russia?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In fact, we never even knew that he was a sharpshooter
or something. We never knew about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No discussion of that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No discussion at all. She just said, we are so
short of money, and this crazy lunatic buys a rifle. This is what she told me.
And you know what happened after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Please. Tell me everything she said on this occasion.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think the most important thing is, that crazy
lunatic bought a rifle when we really need money for other things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she also said he took it out in the park and was shooting
it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Something like that; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, then, what did you do? Go into some other
part of the house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It wasn't very much. I believe it was only two
rooms. And then I returned back, and told George&mdash;do you know what they
have in the closet? I came back to the room, where George and Lee were sitting
and talking. I said, do you know what they have in the closet? A rifle. And
started to laugh about it. And George, of course, with his sense of humor&mdash;Walker
was shot at a few days ago, within that time. He said, "Did you take
a pot shot at Walker by any chance?" And we started laughing our heads
off, big joke, big George's joke. And later on, according to the newspapers,
he admitted that he shot at Walker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, when George made that remark in the presence of Lee
Oswald, "Did you take a pot shot at Walker?" Did you notice any <span class="locked">change&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. We were not looking for any. I wish I would know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Please&mdash;I want only your reaction. Your husband has told
me his. You noticed nothing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I didn't notice anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you looking to see whether he had a change of expression?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; none at all. It was just a joke.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As far as you were concerned, it was a joke?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you did not look at him to see if he reacted?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I didn't take it seriously enough to look at
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You didn't?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long did you remain after that at their home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Not very long. I think we went on the terrace.
And I don't even remember whether we had a drink, a soft drink, or not. And
we left. She got me some roses. They had a big rose tree right by the staircase.
And she got me a lot of roses, and we went home. The baby was asleep.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see the Oswalds on any subsequent occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Never saw them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't remember. I don't think so. What day
was Easter, by the way? Do you remember&mdash;1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Because the 19th of April, we left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You left for New York on the 19th of April?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Nineteenth, from what I recall. I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think Easter was late that year, but I am not certain. In
any event, it was the day before Easter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I believe so; yes. The night before Easter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you left for New York, you were in New York a few
weeks, a couple of weeks?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. We spent about 6 weeks between New York, Washington,
Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you returned to Dallas in May?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. End of May.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you call the Oswalds?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; we didn't. We heard that they were already
gone. I wanted to see them before we went to Haiti. But I understood that they
were gone, or they were going. I had no time. So we didn't get in touch with
them. But we had a card from them from New Orleans, with their address.
But I don't think we ever wrote to them. I don't remember writing. We were
going to send them a Christmas card.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, do you recall an occasion in February of 1963 when there
was a gathering in the evening at the home of, or apartment of Everett Glover?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you and your husband take part in that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; we were showing our movies to Everett's
friends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did that party come about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, you know, we have this quite unusual film,
and quite a few people interested to see it. And, in fact, we showed that film&mdash;the
film so many times, at clubs and gatherings. And he had still quite a few
friends that wanted to see it, and we had a couple of friends. So we decided
to have it. And then he mentioned he knew a woman, Ruth Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are talking about Glover?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; and he said that would be very nice. I was
sort of looking for American couples to introduce Lee and Marina to American
people&mdash;not to Russian refugees&mdash;to get her out of that. So he mentioned that
it would be very nice for Marina to meet this girl, and it was. She was a
young woman, she was interested in Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was her name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Ruth Paine. And that we thought was very good,
because she could help Marina in English and Marina would help her in Russian,
that it would work very well. From what I understand later on from the papers,
she did help a lot, Marina. She did a lot for her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you talk to Marina about this in advance?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't remember. I think maybe I did. I don't
remember. I really don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A few weeks before this, Marina and Lee had visited in your
home, isn't that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Very possible, very possible. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you known Ruth Paine at all prior to this time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Met her the first time that evening, and we liked
her very much, because she is an outgoing, warm, and wonderful person. I
thought that would be terrific for Marina to be close to somebody because I
didn't have time. I just couldn't, and I don't have any patience. When I see
somebody is clicking right away I respond to advice, but she wasn't, you know.
She was too slow, and we have too much problems with our own children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who is too slow?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Marina. We had too many problems with our own
children, and I was just tired of it, you know. After all, she was not my child.
I did everything I could, so let somebody else take over and do something else
because I was too busy, and we were planning this trip. George&mdash;through next
month to Haiti actually to seal this contract. We had our heads busy with other
things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What occurred during that evening? The movie was shown?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. We just showed the movie and discussed it, and the
people asked different questions, peculiar questions about the life of Indians&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About your trip?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. About our trip, and that was all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Weren't these people interested in Marina and Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Some were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Who was present?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. From what I recall at that particular time, it was
just Ruth Paine that we noticed was the most interested in her. I don't even
remember who was there besides. I don't remember who was there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
There were some young people from a mobile research laboratory that worked
with Everett.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From Everett Glover's place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; there were people there. I do believe, I think
we invited the person that owned the apartment house. This time we showed
movies twice at Everett's house, I believe. I think we showed it twice, and we
invited the people that own the apartment house because they were interested in
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What are their names?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't remember. She is teaching in a university,
in Dallas University now. They like to travel a lot, too. I am sure you can
get the name, the list of names of people from Everett.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Lee have a good time at this party, or meeting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't know, because it was always dark when the
movies were shown, so I wasn't observing anybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you bring Lee and Marina to the party?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't believe so. I think somebody else got them,
because I think we had people, out of town guests, and in fact we came in very
late, I think. We arrived quite late that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You arrived at the party late?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; once we were late. I forgot which showing
it was. We had a couple of people out of town. We invited them for dinner,
and then we brought them over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was the only purpose of the meeting that you have indicated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. The only purpose of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The meeting, the only purpose was the one you have indicated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you attend a combination Christmas and New Year's party
in December of 1963 at the Fords?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't know the date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1963.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't know the date, but there was a party, and
we attended it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Please, when you say you don't know the dates, was it in
December? Was it in the holiday period?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It was in the holiday period, but was it December
or was it early January, I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And who was at that party?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. There were quite a lot of people from this Russian
colony and among them there was a little Japanese girl. Do you know about
Yaeko?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Y-a-e-k-o?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you know Yaeko before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; we knew Yaeko before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was her last name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't remember her last name because we always
called her Yaeko.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where was she working?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't know whether she was working at the time
or not, but she was imported by some American family. She came with the
family. She is supposed to be from a very fine Japanese family. She was
wealthy. It was strange she worked almost as a servant in some family.
I know she had only one day off, because I remember when we wanted to invite
her it was only one day, Thursday, that we could invite her. Then she did
some work with Neiman Marcus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Neiman Marcus?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Then she was a musician. She played the Japanese
special long, long instrument, and she was playing with the Dallas Symphony,
and she was also playing at exhibits, Neiman Marcus gives exhibits, you know,
oriental exhibits, whatever it was, that fall, and she was participating in it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
That is what we know about Yaeko. But then we heard that she was in
New York.</p>

<p>To tell you frankly I never trusted Yaeko. I thought there was something
fishy, maybe because I was brought up with Japanese, you know, and I knew
what treachery it is, you know. I just somehow&mdash;she was very pleasant, but
was very strange to me the way she was floating around, you know, and everything.
There is another strange thing happened, too, with that Yaeko.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Involving the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That was very funny because they practically spent
all evening together at that party, and Marina was furious, of course, about it.
And the party that brought Yoico to the party was furious about it, too, and I
don't blame him for it. And from what I understand, Marina told me that
Oswald saw Yaeko after, which was very unusual, because I don't think Oswald
wanted to see anyone, let's put it that way. He would rather just sit by himself
and&mdash;locked in a house, not to see anyone. And, in fact, Marina was
jealous of it, from Yaeko. She was the only person we know that Oswald
really liked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Can you recall the names of the family with whom Yaeko&mdash;by
whom Yaeko was employed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; but I can find out very easily.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Through Dallas. They know the people that actually
introduced Yaeko. It will be Henry Rogatz who knows Yaeko very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Spell that, please.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Two people who can give you everything about
Yoico because they have been carrying on helping her all the time. Henry
Rogatz, also <span class="locked">in&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Henry Rogatz, R-o-g-a-t-z, and Lev Aronson, A-r-o-n-s-o-n?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; and I believe I have Lev's address in my phone
book, if I need it. I can phone you. I don't know if we have Henry's address
now. They are both very nice people, charming people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you do this. Call my hotel, The Madison?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Call later on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And leave a message at my hotel as to Mr. Aronson's address
and telephone number, if you have it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; and maybe we have Henry's address. Maybe
somebody sent it to us because we asked. We didn't have it with us when we
left. We just moved. Voshinin liked Yaeko.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Voshinin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; but I think Henry can tell you much more
than anybody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How, otherwise, did Oswald act at this Christmas party. He
paid a great deal of attention, apparently, <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; they talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To the Japanese girl?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; what did they talk about, I don't have the
slightest idea. But everybody remarked and we were laughing about it. We
were teasing Marina how he had a little Japanese girl now, you now. That was
just as fun, of course, you know. But evidently they not only talked because she
said he saw her later and he liked her. That is what she told me. He really
liked Yaeko.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you bring the Oswalds to the party?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think we brought them. In fact, I had a fight
almost to get them to that party because Cathy didn't want them and we
weren't giving any parties. We gave a big party before, and I wanted Marina
to be at some Christmas party because it was her first Christmas in the United
States, she could have some kind of fun, so I talked her into it finally. She
objected, because she could not bring the baby because the baby would wake up.</p>

<p>I said okay, I'm going to leave the baby with somebody else. So I have
another friend which I talked into babysitting for the baby. So we went,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
we got there, and we left the baby with the friend and then we took them to the
party, and then we went back to the friend, picked up the baby. It was midnight
or whatever it was, and took them back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Earlier in raising this Christmas party matter with you, Mrs.
De Mohrenschildt, I stated that it was in December of 1963. That was a slip
of the tongue, and it was in December of 1962, because in December of 1963 you
were in Haiti.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It was after this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of course, it couldn't be December of 1963.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He was dead already.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By that time, he was not alive. You took the Oswalds home
that evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I believe we did. We just had to, because we had
to go pick up the baby. The baby was crying all evening. That poor woman
was up with her all the time. It was just impossible, that baby was so spoiled,
all the time with her, with her mother, or with Lee, because so few people
came to see them. They lived like mice, you know. That is why we were so
sorry for them.</p>

<p>I wanted for them to meet American couples to get out of it. We tried to
get Marina friendly with George's daughter because she had a little boy, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With whose daughter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. With George's daughter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Alexandra?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; but Alexandra couldn't understand her. She
thought it was horrible the way she treats that baby. It is true she doesn't
know how to raise the baby. Alexandra told me she was lazy, also, and she
wasn't clean, and things like that.</p>

<p>Now I remember how come it was that she wasn't clean. Alexandra was
complaining about her. So Alexandra&mdash;it didn't hit off exactly with Alexandra,
but it was very nice. Her husband went to visit them after, and I think they
helped them to move, even.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Gary Taylor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; Gary is insignificant but a good soul, a good
boy, you know. He is nothing at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean he is not a man of attainment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; but he is a good soul. He is really good, so
I could never be very angry for what happened. It was just a child's prank
that he ran off so early and got married. In fact, I was sorry for him because
I knew he is not going to be happy, not to start with. I knew he was not going
to be. I believe kids helped them quite some and maybe the kids consoled
them after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was anything ever said by Marina or your husband that she
sought to have Oswald leave Russia and come to the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't think so. It is just impressions we had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, was there any discussion at any time, or did anything come
to your attention that Lee Oswald sought to have Marina return to Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. None at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is entirely new to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Absolutely new. Was it such a thing? I shouldn't
ask you any questions. I am sorry, because I am so curious about the whole
thing, myself. In fact, we learned from press 10 times more than we ever knew
about them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You may have gotten a lot of misinformation from the press,
as well.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Could be, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you aware of your husband's letter to Mrs. Auchincloss,
Jacqueline Kennedy's mother?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Did I what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you aware of the <span class="locked">letter&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your husband show you that letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Before he sent it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. He usually shows me most of the letters. I show
to him whenever I write to some friends. But if I want to add anything or if
he wants to add anything to mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I show you De Mohrenschildt Exhibits Nos. 14 and 15, No. 14
being the original of your husband's letter of December 12, 1963, to Mrs. Auchincloss,
and No. 15 being the envelope in which that letter was mailed.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't think I really should read it.</p>

<p>Do you want me to read it again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have read that exhibit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I am just finishing; yes. Do you want me to read
this, too?</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Back on the record.</p>

<p>The second paragraph reads: "Since we lived in Dallas permanently last
year and before, we had the misfortune to have met Oswald and especially his
wife Marina some time last fall." Now, what did you mean by "We had the
misfortune to have met Oswald"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, I am sure he meant, and I agree with him
because it is not pleasant to know if he really did it, to know the killer of
our President, I would rather not know them. I would rather not have anything
to do and be as far away as possible, unless that we help, you know.
That is what he meant, I am sure, and I am joining him in the same feeling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next sentence: "Both my wife and I tried to help poor
Marina, who could not speak any English, was mistreated by her husband.
She and the baby were malnourished and sickly."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, all that is true; isn't it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Absolutely true. She was just skin and bones.
The baby was not thin, but the baby had improper diet. She didn't know how
to feed that baby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She did not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She had no idea how to feed that baby. The baby
was raised on sugar, water and sugar, no food. It is just terrible, like prehistoric
times she was raising that baby. That is why I insisted immediately
she register the baby in the clinic. The baby was 9 months old, didn't have
diptheria, whooping cough, polio injection, didn't have anything.</p>

<p>I don't think the baby was ever at the doctor. The way she was feeding
him every time the baby cried she gave him sugar water, put sugar in the
milk, everywhere, you know. Children have to have a proper diet, a balanced
diet.</p>

<p>I told her, "You are living in a civilized country now. You have to raise a
baby correctly."</p>

<p>She constantly put the pacifier in the mouth, dropping it on the floor, putting
it in her mouth, infected teeth and putting it in the baby's mouth. It is
fantastic the baby wasn't sick all the time. Seeing all that, I couldn't stand
it. I insisted on her taking the baby to the clinic, helping her, extract all those
teeth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Marina's teeth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; Marina's teeth that were infected because they
weren't doing her any good, anyway. It was too dangerous for the baby to
be close to the mother, with all this infection. In fact, I was trying to make
arrangements to make some bridges for her later on that could be paid gradually,
you know, and that is what I was trying to do for her. This was logical
and natural. Anybody would do the same thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; of course.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She just didn't know any better, you know. That
was shocking to me because I had the impression, in fact Marina doesn't fit
at all my ideal, not ideal but how to say it, my feeling about Soviet youth.
I pictured them entirely different. I pictured them all sportsmen, very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
tough, you know, just thinking of their work, sportsmen or something, you
know. Some field that they are interested in and that is it. She seems to be
exactly opposite to everything. She wasn't a sports girl at all. She didn't
have any particular desire for anything, you know. She didn't have determination
and goal or anything like that in her life. She was just loving, you
know, absolutely opposite, and when she told us how they behave in Russia,
that was absolutely too&mdash;I never thought that. I thought they were very,
very proper and <span class="locked">very&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did she say about how they behaved?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, these sort of orgies, you know, wild parties,
and things like that that I would never think that youth would be busy with
that because we saw some youngsters in Yugoslavian companies in the camps,
maybe we saw the healthier ones and the bad ones stayed in the city probably,
but they were all just like Scouts, you know, just like we were brought up,
all interested in sports or in collections or something, you know. They had
wonderful healthy interests.</p>

<p>And Marina was exactly opposite all of these things. In fact, in spite of that,
she was a pharmacologist, that means she has a good head. But somehow she
was not at all what I would picture as a Soviet girl. It was entirely opposite,
and maybe she is an exception, or maybe they all are, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she related to you these wild parties and orgies in Minsk?
Was that in the presence of Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; I don't think so. Lee was there very, very
little, because he was always working or something. One evening I talked with
her very long when she came over to go to the dentist, and the baby was asleep
and George was asleep, and she wanted to talk, and we sat down and had some
wine and she could smoke all she wanted and she had wine that she wanted.
So she told me quite a lot of things. I was really sorry for her.</p>

<p>I gave her a nylon nightgown and a little nylon coat that went on and she
was sitting and touching it. "Can you imagine me wearing that," you know.
It was to her something out of this world, to have such things on her. That was
sort of touching, you know. She really is pleasant. You cannot be very angry
with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have testified for quite awhile. Now, tell me what kind of
a person she was? What is your definite impression now? You have told me
she told you about these wild orgies. When you use that expression I assume
they were parties <span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Sexual orgies. I mean the things that would never
occur to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In this country?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In this country. I would say China, too. I was
brought up in China and never heard of such things, you know. Youth never
acted like that at all.</p>

<p>So it definitely looks like a degeneration, you know, definitely degeneration.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You found her, while you knew she was a <span class="locked">pharmacist&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You immediately noticed that she was ignorant, let me say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. In bringing up the child?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In bringing up this child?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Absolutely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That she fed her sugar and water?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Milk and sugar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Milk and sugar and was unattentive as to cleanliness with the
child?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. The child was more or less clean, but with this
pacifier thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The pacifier would fall on the floor, she would pick it up and stick
it in the baby's mouth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; first she put it in her infected mouth and then
in the baby's mouth, it was even worse. That is what I objected. Pick it up
off the floor. The floor was less germs than her infected teeth, but she was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
aware of it. That is what didn't make sense, didn't make sense at all. After
all, a pharmacist&mdash;it also didn't make any sense to me how could she, came from
the country where all the medical help is supposed to be absolutely free.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Can you recall any other incidents?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. With Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't recollect of anything of any importance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Indicating what kind of a person she was. What about her
honesty? Would you believe her under oath, where her personal interests were
involved, let us say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't know. I tell you what I didn't like about
her recently and sort of swayed me a little against her. According to what I
read in the newspapers, she said when she was asked&mdash;I mean what swayed me
about her <span class="locked">personality&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I don't want you influenced by what you read in the papers afterward.
I want your opinion.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She impressed me as an honest girl. She really impressed
me as an honest girl, and not malicious, not malicious, promiscuous, you
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Promiscuous.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was promiscuous but not malicious?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Not malicious. That is how I would put it, you
know. She was so anxious to live and she was so happy to be in the United
States. She wanted to have it all, you know what I mean? She wanted a car
and she wanted to have a little apartment and have all these little gadgets that
fascinated her, just like they fascinated me when I came to the United States.
She was living in that poor, poor apartment. Of course, it was depressing for
her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was she talking to Lee about all, that she wanted a car and
these gadgets and a refrigerator?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I cannot say she did, but I am sure she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your husband recalls that you and he, at least he, suggested to
them that they should buy a car. They could get one for very little money.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I believe we talked about it. But I don't know if
he even drives a car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever see him drive a car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any discussion at any time in your presence indicating
whether he could or couldn't drive a car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't remember. I think we had them in a car
only once talking, you know, and she expressed how wonderful it would be to
have a car, something like that, this is the only recollection I have. We didn't
have too much discussions about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You took the baby to the clinic for various shots?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Registered her, yes; and I got her card and the dates
when she is supposed to come over, and I didn't take her next time. Somebody
else took her. I took her only once to the clinic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So, as a matter of fact, Mrs. Dymitruk took her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. She did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You recall Mrs. Dymitruk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I know her very little, but I recall her. I think it
is Lydia, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You also took her to the dentist. Was that at Baylor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. It was a dental clinic, I believe. It was in Baylor
Hospital, dental clinic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Some money had to be paid in that connection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you got that money from George Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right, and he told me there would be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
necessity of more money there would be no objection if he got some funds for
them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That if there was need for additional <span class="locked">money&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. More money, yes, he had some funds to help them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, the next paragraph of this letter reads: "Some time last
fall we heard that Oswald had beaten his wife cruelly, so we drove to their
miserable place and forcibly took Marina and the child away from the character."
You have told us about that incident, have you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then it reads: "Then he threatened me and my wife, but I did
not take him seriously." You have told us about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. "Marina stayed with the family of some childless Russian refugees
for awhile, keeping her baby, but finally decided to return to her husband." Is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You recall that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that the Mellers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That was the Mellers, and she went back within a
week or two instead of as she promised to be apart for 2 or 3 months. We were
really furious. We wasted the whole day, so much aggravation, go through all
that trying to do something for them and then she dropped the whole thing. So
why bother, you know? So from then on we were really disgusted. After all,
you can waste so much time, and if we don't see anything, response, you know
we are just tired of it. Let them live their own rights. Let them battle their
own battles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did the occasion arise then shortly thereafter in which Marina
left Lee and went with some others?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't even remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You do recall a time when she was with Mrs. Ford?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't recall it. I think she lived with them, too.
I think so, but I don't know exactly when and how, because we hardly ever saw
them from then on. Just occasionally all of a sudden I'd get sorry and I'd go
and buy a cake, you know, a cheesecake or something and we'd just drive by
and drop it and just talk with them a few minutes and leave. That is about
the only things we had, the only connection we had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next paragraph: "It is really a shame that such crimes occur
in our times and in our country. But there is so much jealousy for success and
the late President was successful in so many domains and there is so much
desire for publicity on the part of all shady characters that assassinations are
bound to occur." Did your husband discuss that sentence with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No, we didn't discuss any sentences of this letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you read the letter before it was mailed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I read the letter.</p>

<p>The only thing I can say what he meant by it is that it seems to be that
everything went wrong for Lee, starting with his childhood, you know, and no
matter what he did it was always a failure. So anything that seems to be
President Kennedy touched was turning into gold, he was so successful in his
marriage. You know he was such a wonderful President and he had health and
public office, everything, you know, so it could be that in the bottom of Lee's
heart was some antagonism, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have that impression of the man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No, never at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any impression that he was envious at any time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No, and in fact that is what doesn't make any sense,
because I don't think he ever said anything against, and whatever the President
was doing, Kennedy was doing, Lee was completely exactly with the same ideas,
exactly. If he would shoot Walker that would be understandable, even if he
would be shooting at Connally that is understandable, too. We learned that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
Connally refused him honorable discharge, so he had a grudge against Connally,
but President Kennedy, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Please, did you know anything about the discharge incident?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No. We read it in the papers after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I want to keep separated here what you learned about afterwards.</p>

<p>Governor Connally was never mentioned at any time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That you had any contact with the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was his discharge from the Marines, was that subject ever
mentioned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was his boyhood ever mentioned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. His boyhood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Boyhood.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No. Never, never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say anything that he had lived in poverty or hadn't lived
in poverty, that he had difficulty all his life?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No, no; we never discussed that. I don't remember
discussing that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any mention of his Marine record, his record in the
service, and what he had done?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No. I don't recall any conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So this paragraph that I have read, that is about it being
a shame that crimes occur and there is so much jealousy for success, that was
rationalization afterwards?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Absolutely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then your husband says in this letter: "Better precautions
should have been taken."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Right. I agree.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you discuss that with your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I agree. I didn't discuss that with him, but better
precautions should be taken, especially when we learned later on that Adlai
Stevenson was treated very poorly in Dallas, so they should have known that
there were antagonism towards the Democrats, and they had no right really
to permit the President to ride like that without that bubble after such demonstrations
against Stevenson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So this remark in the letter is based on that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. On that, exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is as far as you are concerned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. As far as we are concerned, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your husband may have had something else in mind?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't know. I don't think so, but he may. Did
he mention to you that we have this Birch Society in Texas, the right wing,
extreme right wing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You go ahead if you have anything to say about that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't know if he mentioned it. He probably did.
That there is a Democrat Party split, you know. The Republicans are one but
the Democrats are two. A lot of Democrats didn't like what Kennedy was
doing, especially they didn't like this approach to segregation, you know, and
many other things. They thought he was too forward, too fast. Lots of people
thought he was too young, you know. And so there was a lot <span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Animosity?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Disturbances. Not exactly animosity, but they
didn't exactly appreciate what Kennedy was doing and they were still Democrats.
That is really terrible. That Birch Society is a horrible thing. It is
almost like Ku Klux Klan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He also says on the second page of his letter: "I do hope that
Marina and her children (I understand she has two now) will not suffer too
badly throughout their lives and that the stigma will not affect the innocent
children. Somehow, I still have a lingering doubt, notwithstanding all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
evidence, of Oswald's guilt." Now, that last sentence, did your husband discuss
that with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. We talk about it very often.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you talk about it at the time he wrote this letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No. He wrote the letter, I wasn't there. In fact,
I saw the letter accidentally because I just stopped by his office for something
and he said, "I just finished a letter. Please mail it for me," or something like
that, you know. Otherwise, maybe I wouldn't even see the letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In any event, he did not discuss it with you before he prepared
the letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; not at all. In fact I did never know he was
going to write the letter. I don't think he told me anything. He just wrote the
letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you take Marina to the dental clinic or laboratory more than
once?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I think I took her twice there, I believe. They
couldn't do it all at once. It was too much. One thing impressed me while
we were in the clinic. You know she sort of perked up. It gave her a feeling
that she was like back. She liked the uniform, you know. She said how it
would be wonderful if she could work, also, be a pharmacist again and do something.
That is when I told her learn English and you can do anything. The
sky is the limit.</p>

<p>Did my husband mention to you about a strange thing about the Voshinins?
It could be something or could be nothing, you see. It could be excused or maybe
something they knew about Oswald. They refused to meet him. They refused
to meet them, and it came to a point, you know I am pretty persistent
when I want something and I was after her, I said, "For God sakes, you are
always carrying on with every little Russian and this and that." I am not
interested, but she is. "How come you still didn't meet the Oswalds?"</p>

<p>She said, "Don't ever mention it to me again. We have a reason."</p>

<p>I said, "What are the reasons?"</p>

<p>She said, "I cannot tell you."</p>

<p>Maybe it was an excuse that she just didn't want to, hearing of his personality.
Maybe there is something else, I don't know. But that was very strange because
they always carry on with every Russian, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you gave them these language records?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. A phonograph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A little phonograph to play them on. You gave them money
that you had received from George Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you didn't give them any of your own money?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Not that I ever recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You brought them gifts?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Just tiny little things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. You gave her some clothing.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I personally didn't. She didn't need it already. By
the time we got to know her she had too much clothes and my clothes was too
big for her. I was trying to fit her some of my things, some slacks or something.
They were too big. It was too much trouble to have it altered for her and
she didn't need to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mentioned on one occasion when she was at your home
overnight you gave <span class="locked">her&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is just for the night, the nightgown, like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know if Oswald received any financial assistance in
addition to that which he received from Mr. Bouhe? Did Oswald ever discuss
his finances with you and your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't think so. I don't think we talked much
about that. It is just that it is pretty tight because they have to pay out the
debt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he ever express any views that were antagonistic to the
United States and its form of government?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Never. He objected to the way the integration
question was handled, in this way. And I think we all do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was opposed to segregation, was he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Of course, he was opposed to segregation. He
wanted complete equality of rights because those people are just American
as everybody else so it is really one of the worst problems we have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I appreciate that, but I am trying to find out what his views
were.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; he is completely in accord with President
Kennedy's policy on the subject. That is why it doesn't make exactly sense.
He has no reason whatsoever, to our knowledge. Maybe he had something
inside which he never disclosed to us, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, there have been interruptions yesterday and today in
which we have been off the record and we have had some discussions. Is there
anything that you have said to me or I have said to you off the record, that is,
not when it was taken down, that I have failed to bring out that you might
regard in any degree pertinent to this investigation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, the only thing, the question I actually
brought up yesterday, it was not about Oswald. I mean in my thinking it
was. I think you should investigate Ruby inside out because it just doesn't
make any sense. That is what bothers me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Otherwise known as Jack Rubinstein?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Never heard of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you or your husband ever frequent or were you ever in
the Carousel Club or any of those night clubs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That he operated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were people in the Russian colony, including yourself, disposed
to attend that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; not at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever hear Oswald mention the name Jack Ruby or Jack
Rubinstein?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I never heard him mention that. I don't recall
ever hearing it. I didn't know of his existence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You say that Oswald was a temperate man, I mean as far as
drinking is concerned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Oh, yes; he wouldn't drink.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you ever seen Jack Ruby in the flesh?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I mean apart from newsreels?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. TV? No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Marina ever mention Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No; not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was anything ever said that led you to believe or indicated that
either he or she separately or together had ever frequented any of Jack Ruby's
places?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Nothing at all. The only link I am searching for
is that I don't believe Jack Ruby did it because of his good intentions. I think
there is something behind that killing. That is all there is to it. Until it is
proven, I remain with my opinion, let's put it that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But your opinion is formed on what you have read in the
newspapers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; that is the only thing I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And not on any actual facts you know anything about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. No, sir; and, also based on the natural deduction because
I adore mystery stories and it just doesn't make any sense. The whole
evidence just points to&mdash;the thing is much too simple. How could it be that if
Oswald did it, could he be that completely stupid to leave the plans, according
to the newspapers we learn of the march route of the Kennedy thing. Wouldn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
he try to cover it up a little bit, you know? It doesn't make sense at all to me.
I tell you the things that don't make sense to me. That was No. 1 doesn't make
any sense.</p>

<p>No. 2, knowing more or less and observing him as a personality, if he would
have done it he would say "I did it" and he would boast about it yet. That
is the kind of a person he is. For some reason he clammed up for 2 days, and
I know the Dallas police is pretty rough. He didn't have a good time, I am
sure, and he did not.</p>

<p>What was his reasons? Maybe he was frightened he didn't want to admit
it, he decided maybe, and maybe he didn't do it. How do I know?</p>

<p>It doesn't make sense at all. Anybody could take the rifle out of the garage.
I understand it was wrapped up in a blanket and standing in a garage at
Ruth Paine's; anybody could do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You know nothing about any rifle except on that Saturday, that
Easter Saturday when you went to their home? That is the first time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That you knew anything about a rifle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, is there anything that occurs to you that you think might
be helpful to the Commission that you would like to add?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I can't think of anything. The only thing, I would
like to definitely dip into is Yaeko, because that is the only person that was, you
know, what I mean&mdash;maybe it was just because she is an intelligent girl and
she likes to read a lot. Maybe they discussed some books, they hit it off this
way, you know. Maybe he was attracted to her just as a cute Japanese girl.
I understand he was with Marines staying in the east.</p>

<p>Oh, yes; I remember now. He was always telling&mdash;Marina was telling me
the Japanese are such wonderful girls. They make such good wives and so
on and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is, Oswald had told her that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; and that is why Marina was so irritated that
he liked Yaeko. And she was sort of blase about it. He can take her, you know,
take his little Japanese girl; she doesn't need him, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She needled him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; she needled him with Yaeko. It may be completely
imagination, you know, all of these things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have appeared voluntarily?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. What did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have appeared voluntarily for the taking of your deposition?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Oh, absolutely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You and your husband received a letter, did you not, from
Mr. Rankin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. General counsel of the Commission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And with which was enclosed a copy of the Senate Joint Resolution
137?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which is the legislation under which the Commission was created,
and a copy of President Lyndon <span class="locked">Johnson's&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; two copies.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. His Executive order creating the Commission, No. 11130?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And fixing its responsibilities?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; I don't know the details, but I assumed that
is what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you also received a copy of the regulations and rules under
which these proceedings of the Commission are undertaken?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't remember. I probably did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I have no more. I appreciate very much your coming, and the
Commission does. This has been somewhat of a burden, of course, to you and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
your husband, and your involvement with the Oswalds unfortunately has led
to this.</p>

<p>Your husband has told us in considerable detail about the Haiti venture.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; you know this hurts us very much. You
know Haiti is just like Dallas in a way. We have been gone for 10 days in
Santo Domingo, San Juan, Santo Domingo. We come back three or four people
said, "The American Embassy is looking for you." This alone, this fact alone
is sufficient to start people thinking what is wrong with us that the American
Embassy is looking for us, you know. That is how people are. So this is not
very good, and I am sure my husband told you there was something else was
done in Haiti. You know somebody wrote some kind of letter to the president,
you know, which we don't know. The Ambassador is looking into it and there
is a couple of people we suggested for him to see here to clear that out. That
hurts very badly. I tell you another thing what hurts us very badly. I don't
mind to come here at all and in fact it would be different another 2 weeks from
now and I would enjoy the visit here very much. It is just not too timely
because of my dogs in this condition to travel is misery. But in driving in this
morning we called our lawyer in Philadelphia to see his little girl and he said,
"Under those circumstances, you are forbidden to see your child."</p>

<p>The FBI was questioning him, was questioning his wife, was questioning
the lawyer and the lawyer's wife told him that this time George did something
very big.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, he didn't.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Well, that is what is happening, you understand.
Here are the results. So it is the suggestion that we are going to fly there.
We cannot do it tomorrow. The court is closed. We have to go to court and
see maybe the court's order to permit, to see the child. So you see this affects
us in someway. If you can somehow&mdash;at the moment we are concerned, of
course, about Haiti and Haiti's project because a very good thing for everybody
concerned. It improves the relations between the countries. It may help the
poor people because he discovered quite a few things, and if he can bring
capital here and mine it and make use of it, it will be wonderful, and the
American people will make money and the Haitian people will benefit by it.
He is doing something constructive, and he is really working with full heart.</p>

<p>The country is beautiful. We have gone on trips, he takes me whenever
possible and he is really doing something constructive.</p>

<p>By people's ignorance it reflects on us, and he may lose the whole thing.
Is there anyway in the future, can I discuss it with the FBI, if they want
to know anything they want to know, do it in a more discreet way, because
it definitely affects the businesswise, especially George, you know, he is foreign
born. He has a long, long name. He looks a little bit like a German, you know.
Everything is against foreigners, let's put it that way, and it is difficult, very,
very difficult.</p>

<p>For no reason at all, we have all the time the kicks back to us, and when
the man from the FBI came over to Port-au-Prince, you know, and he made
the remark, "Why don't you like the FBI, George, why don't you like FBI?"
I told him why we don't like FBI and we have good reasons, because you hurt
us. You hurt us very much for no reason at all, asking people questions, and
people beginning to think why would a person that is nice and quiet make
people ask questions about this person? The minute somebody starts asking
questions, it means something to it. That is what happens. How can we avoid
it? How can it be stopped?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We will see what we can do about it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Really, I mean you are aware, maybe you can in
conjunction, do something about it because I do understand that we should
have Secret Service but let's have a little more secret. It is not secret enough
if they just go and openly ask all the time about the character of the person,
personality or this and that, you know. That leaves a very bad reflection and
it could be that we wouldn't be able to see the little girl.</p>

<p>We are going back to Haiti. It could be right now we will be hurt by it.
I told George, "Are you sure he told you the FBI came to see?"</p>

<p>He said, "Yes," so here we are. That is one thing. We will do anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
we can do to help because it is our duty and I cannot say it is a pleasure, but
we are glad to do anything we can, but we cannot be hurt like that because
George would lose that now, you know we will be in a rough spot again until
something else come up and nobody knows when it will come up.</p>

<p>For me, right now it is very difficult in designing because I don't like to live
in New York. In New York I can have fantastic job in 2 minutes, but I don't
want to live in New York, I don't like the climate, and in Dallas people are so
narrowminded, you know.</p>

<p>Now that we knew Oswalds you know they really think we are boogeyman
or something. So it is really rough for both of us, and we are very anxious
that something would be done that wouldn't affect us in Haiti, let's put it, at
the moment, and in future, especially with George's little girl.</p>

<p>If you can do anything about it, we would greatly appreciate it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. You want the addresses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No; those names will be sufficient for us. Our procedure is
that you may read your deposition if you wish, and then sign it. But you may
also waive that. You don't have to do it unless you wish.</p>

<p>Your husband decided that he might be curious enough to read his deposition,
but if he didn't appear today that that meant he waived the necessity of
reading it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes; he is too busy. He has so many little things
to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you like to handle it the way he has handled it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I am sure, because if something was not just exactly
so, I don't think it really matters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. These men are quite competent and they take down everything.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. That is wonderful.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then you will waive your reading and signing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. Yes. Do you want me to sign it? Does it have to be
signed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No; not unless you insist on it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">De Mohrenschildt</span>. I don't care. It doesn't matter one way or the other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you very, very much.</p>

<h2 id="rhp">TESTIMONY OF RUTH HYDE PAINE</h2>

<p>The testimony of Ruth Hyde Paine was taken at 9:15 a.m., on March 21, 1964,
at 200 Maryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C., by Messrs. Albert E. Jenner, Jr.,
and Norman Redlich, assistant counsels of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Let the record show that this is a continuation by deposition
pursuant to leave granted by the Commission of Mrs. Paine's testimony before
the Commission which we had concluded late in the day <span class="locked">yesterday.<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2" href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">1</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote narrow">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_2" id="Footnote_1_2" href="#FNanchor_1_2" class="fnanchor">1</a> The testimony of Mrs. Ruth Paine given before the Commission appears in another
volume, and can be found by consulting the Index.</p></div>

<p>I think it might be well, in view of that transition, if Mrs. Paine were sworn
again, or if you were affirmed, rather.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Reporter</span>. Do you affirm that the testimony you are about to give will
be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think we might cover your background to some extent, Mrs.
Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. My material indicates that you were born in New York City.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In 1932.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you remained in New York City until when?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think that time I stayed about 2 weeks, just long enough to get
out of the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. Immediately after your birth, or substantially so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My family moved to New Jersey.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your family moved to New Jersey. And you lived where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I believe it was Park Ridge, N.J. We had lived there before, I
remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But do you recall then moving from Park Ridge, N.J.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I first recall living in the country not far from Freehold, N.J.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you did eventually move to Columbus, Ohio?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We moved back to New York when I was 8, and from New York
then moved to Columbus, Ohio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what age were you when you moved to Columbus, Ohio?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I must have been 10 or about to be 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you attended elementary schools and high school in
Columbus?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is my information correct that you entered Antioch College at
Antioch, Ohio, in 1950?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In Yellow Springs, Ohio, in 1949.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1949 was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you eventually received a degree from Antioch College?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did, in 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You might state for the record what the character of Antioch
College is. It is special in some respect, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it has a work-study plan, whereby the students study a portion
of the year and then go to jobs all over the country, to work in special fields,
a job of their own interest, and the college helps to obtain these positions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And do you receive any kind of credit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In order to graduate, you have to have both credit in the academic
work and credit from your job placements.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does Antioch College&mdash;I know you said you were of the Quaker
faith&mdash;does Antioch College have any connection with the Quaker faith?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; it doesn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your major at Antioch College?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I majored in education.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And seeking to prepare yourself as a teacher?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you pursue that major or at least activities in connection
with that major in your cooperative work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I did. I was also interested in group work and in recreation
work, but there was no major in that field at Antioch, so my job
placements were a combination of both work in elementary schools and group
work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And have you pursued, really pursued your interests in group
work ever since?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or group activities, at least?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I pursued the dual interest of education and group work, yes,
in the jobs I have sought.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had by that time already embraced the Quaker faith, hadn't
you, when you entered Antioch, at the time you entered Antioch College?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. At the time I entered I was not yet a member. I joined in the
winter of 1951, so it was still a year and a quarter before I became a member.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mentioned 1947 yesterday. Was that <span class="locked">a&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was when I first became acquainted with the Quakers and
their beliefs, and I was active in attending the Friends meeting in Columbus
from that time on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, these cooperative studies, my information indicates that
in the first quarter of 1950, that is, January through March, you were recreation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
instructor and a leader in the Jewish community at Indianapolis, Ind.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And do I correctly summarize in capsule form the nature of
your work at the Jewish Community Center in Indianapolis?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is recreation instructor and leader?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then in the summer of 1950 you were a camp counselor at Big
Eagle Camp at Indianapolis, Ind.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Also, apparently&mdash;I am not certain of this&mdash;that during the
summer of 1950 you served as a recreation leader of the American Friends
Service Committee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; that would have been the following summer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That would be 1951?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And where did that take place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. With the American Friends Service Committee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was in Rapid City, S. Dak., as part of an American
Friends Service Committee work camp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And then in the fall quarter 1951, that is October, apparently,
through January 1952, and then March through May of 1952 you were a recreation
instructor and a leader in the Downtown Community School in New
York City, N.Y.; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is after reentering Antioch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right. The job you describe was part of my work placement
from Antioch College.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; I had so understood.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you. And then the quarter October through December
1952 you were a recreation leader at the Jewish Community Center in the
city of Columbus Recreation Department. Do I have those correctly stated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was a period of 8 weeks; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was your position a position of recreation leader?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that was part of the cooperative schedule; was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then September and October 1953 and January through March
1954 you were an elementary school teacher at the Mad River Township
School, Dayton, Ohio.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you teach?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I taught first graders. I particularly had the slow learning
class.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that was part of the cooperative program at Antioch;
was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then in the summer of 1954, June and July, my notes indicate
a summer tour with the American Friends Service Committee; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I recall that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you state what the nature of that was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was not with the American Friends Service Committee; it
was with a different group of Friends, with the <span class="locked">Friends&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me&mdash;Friends in this connection is spelled with a capital
F? Forgive my interruption.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, this was a tour sponsored by the Friends World Committee.
We did some traveling and the tour included a summer term at Pendle Hill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where is Pendle Hill?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Pendle Hill is in the Philadelphia suburban area, and it is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
school for religious and social studies maintained by the Society of Friends,
Quakers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it all one word, Pendlehill, or two words?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Two words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You told us yesterday that in the summer of 1952 you were a
delegate to&mdash;state it again.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The Friends World Conference, at Oxford.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oxford, England?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. England.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you also <span class="locked">attended&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. A Young Friends Conference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At Reading, England.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then the period August 1954 through May 1955, you were associated
with the Young Men's Hebrew Association and the Young Women's Hebrew
Association of Philadelphia, Pa.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were particularly given an assignment, and I may say
everybody anticipated it being a difficult one, of working with the Golden Age
Club. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I had three club assignments and this was the one that took
the most time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please tell us what those assignments were? You say
there were three.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I worked with the Golden Age Club as you have already
said, with a group of young adults, and also with an open lounge, recreation
lounge with games and playing cards, newspapers, for members' use.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think it would profit us in bringing out your background if you
take those three groups and in capsule form tell us what your work in connection
with those groups was. Take the Golden Age Club first. They were a
group of what people?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The Golden Age Club consisted of people over the age of 60, all
of them Jewish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were they all emigres?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To the best of my knowledge, all or certainly nearly all were
emigres. In fact, most of them had come from, a good many of them had come
from Kiev, and they had come around the turn of the century.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is a city in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; and they spoke Yiddish in conducting their business meetings,
to one another, although since most of them, all of them had been in this
country for a long time they understood English and spoke it. There were some
who did not read and write English, and I undertook to teach a few.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your particular activity in connection with this group?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was to help them in achieving their plans for parties and club
activities and to act as liaison between the club and the Y, which sponsored the
club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were these elderly people, set in their ways, who avoided change?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I felt it would be quite a remarkable group of very interesting
people, and very able people. I felt that as a club leader I didn't really need to
do much more than stay out of their way and help them in communication between
one another and specifically in communication between the club and the
organization, the Y.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In general, what was their view towards the United States of
America, as a group?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, they loved America very much. They raised their families
here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is the first of those three groups.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the next?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The second was the group of young adults that met once a week.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did they have any particular characteristic other than that they
were a group of young adults?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They were a group of older young adults. They particularly
needed to make social contact and some of them just to learn how to date and
meet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were they likewise people who had come from Russia or Poland?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, no; they had been born here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They were apparently disadvantaged in some respect. Would
you indicate what that was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I felt they were not as able a group. The individuals in the
group were not as able as the ones in the Golden Age Club, and they needed a
great deal of help in their planning and in achieving simple party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your work actually was group activity, singing groups, dancing
groups or activities, rather, was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not particularly singing and dancing. Again, of course, it was
liaison between this club and the Y. But leadership here was more in the role
of enabling them to achieve what they wanted than being the visible head of
the group. The group had its own president and officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have to do any teaching in connection with either the
Golden Age or the young adults group?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The third was, I think you described it, as the lounge.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it was an informal lounge for members of the Y. They
could come in and play chess, checkers, talk, read magazines. This required
the least from me in the leadership.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was in this connection that you acquired some interest, or
at least you attempted to acquire a facility in the Yiddish language?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; because of my work with the Golden Age Club. I had
already studied some German so that I understood. The two languages are
similar enough that I understood some of the content of their business meeting
which they conducted in Yiddish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I have forgotten now, if you will forgive me. By this time had
you taken a course in Russian at the university?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I hadn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had these activities at least in part that we have gone through
this morning awakened, or stimulated your interest in the study of Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; had these activities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Stimulated my interest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will jump way back now, go backward a little bit to your
pre-Antioch College period of activity.</p>

<p>Do you recall that as early as 1945&mdash;1946, that you were part of or at least
engaged in the activities of the World Truck Farm in Elyria, Ohio?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Wolfe is the name. It is the man's name; the owner's name;
Wolfe Truck Farm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was a <span class="locked">private&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is just a private farm; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I thought it was an activity, and it arose out of the fact that
the word "World" instead of "Wolfe" was furnished to me.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Wolfe's Truck Farm?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was. This was a group of girls and all from Columbus,
Ohio, all from the school I was just entering at that time, and at a time when
labor was very hard to find, just at the end of the war.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You say entering a school at that time.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was about to enter high school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was high school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And we earned a small amount for our work there, and we
felt patriotic in helping to supply labor where it was needed, because so many
of the young men were away at war, or in the Army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall that in 1947 you served as a teacher in the Friends
Vacation Bible School?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us a little bit about that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This is the same summer when I was first introduced to Friends
activities, and I was asked to be a leader, a teacher with a traveling Bible
school. We went to three different small towns in Indiana and Ohio, and taught
young children. I led songs and games and read stories.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So at this time you were 15 years old, 14 or 15, right in there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In 1948 you served as a leader in craftwork at the Presbyterian
Bible School in Columbus, Ohio?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us a little bit more about that activity.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was similar to what I had done the year before. I had enjoyed
it the previous summer and looked for Bible school work then in Columbus.
You have described it entirely. It was working with crafts <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. Did I interrupt you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Working with children in crafts with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Also in 1948 you were an assistant in children's physical education
work at the Universal School, Columbus, Ohio?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. University.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. University, was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This was the school I attended.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was your high school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This was the high school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you also served as assistant in the children's physical
education activities?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall that in 1949 you were a leader and counselor to
underprivileged children, a children's club group in Columbus, Ohio?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you describe that more fully and also what the particular
group was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was exactly as you have described it, a group of underprivileged
children. We were without an agency in particular, and no particular
place to meet, but we met in the homes of the families. This was basically
sponsored by the families.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By the families themselves?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; and I had volunteered to a friend of mine who had worked
with these families previously, to lead a weekly club group meeting, and, again,
the activities were songs and dancing and craftwork. I guess not dancing&mdash;more
likely stories.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were these quite young children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They ranged in age from, perhaps, 7 or 8 to 13. I had a helper
who was 13.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you do some teaching at Pendle Hill eventually?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You have not mentioned one time when I attended. I attended
in <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I meant to ask you if I had left out anything.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I attended Pendle Hill first in the fall of 1950, for the fall term.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That ran over a little bit into 1951, didn't it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; it closed with the Christmas holidays.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you return to the Friends School or Pendle Hill and do some
work in 1956?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You are talking about Pendle Hill? I don't recall; no. I may
have occasionally attended a lecture, but that is different.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think we might help this way. You were married to Michael
R. Paine on the 28th of December, 1957?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In what activity were you engaged at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was teaching school at the Germantown Friends School. Germantown
is a section of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When had you commenced that activity, that is, teaching at
Germantown Friends School?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I began in the fall of 1956, worked there 1956 to 1957 and 1957 to
1958 school years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you do? What was your work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was the playground director and rhythm and dance teacher for
grades 1 through 6.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During all of that period?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. During those 2 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did the Germantown Friends School have anything to do with
Pendle Hill?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. That is where my confusion arose.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have already mentioned you attended various Friends conferences
over this period of years, did you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you maintained a lively interest in the activities of the
Friends Conferences, especially the young people's groups?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You already mentioned or made some reference to a Friends Conference
at Quaker Haven, Ind., September 1955, I believe in your testimony, have
you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think it would have been August.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. August 1955?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It has to have been before school started.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it with respect to this conference that you mentioned the
Young Friends of North America meetings, and that you were active in that
group, and that group was interested in easing the tensions between the east
and the west?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was a subcommittee of that group that had that particular
interest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And out of this interest and activity arose the Russian pen pal
activity and bringing of some Russian students over to America to see and
observe America?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I won't go into that. I think we covered it enough yesterday.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you say that was your initial interest in the Russian
language or at least the pursuit of the study of the Russian language arose
about that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My interest arose about that time. Pursuit didn't begin until
later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In some of the materials I have seen there is mention of a Young
Friends meeting or conference at Earlham College in Richmond, Ind. I think
you made some reference to that yesterday, did you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was a conference, a Young Friends Conference at Earlham
in 1947. That was the first one I ever attended. Is <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No; well, I don't wish to say that isn't so, but you did attend
another one in 1954&ndash;55, along in that time, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There are a great many meetings for the Young Friends Committee
of North America, and they were commonly held at Earlham College,
but they were not conferences.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. I am using the wrong terminology.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; these were committee meetings and there were a number
of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was in further pursuit of the exchange of the interest by pen
pal letters and otherwise between young people in America and young people in
Russia?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This would have been one of the subjects of the committee
meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there, or was there a Russian Friends group in Wallingford, in
Philadelphia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You mean people who were both Russian and Quakers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am not too sure just what I do mean, because my information
is so limited.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It brings nothing to my mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It does not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It would appear that this was, my notes are a little garbled, I see,
that the three Soviet students to whom you made reference yesterday came
over here in 1958. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That fits with my memory of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it was the Young Friends group in which you were interested
which stimulated, in cooperation with the State Department, as I recall it, the
bringing of these three young Soviet students over here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We sought advice from the State Department; yes; and from
the American Friends Service Committee, also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And we covered that yesterday so we needn't trouble you with it
again. Your only participation or contact with these three Soviet students, I
understand from your testimony, was you attended one meeting&mdash;was it a dinner&mdash;and
you had no other contacts with them, either before or after?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They went on from&mdash;where was this, in Philadelphia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And they went on from there to see other parts of America?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you ever met knowingly, that is, that you knew, any native
Russian people other than these three Russian students and Marina, that is to
say up to November <span class="locked">22&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You mean people who had been born there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. Well, of course, your golden age group. There were some
who had been born in Russia.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. A great many. I am not certain where Mrs. Gravitis was born.
I think she was born in Latvia. Any such contact was certainly in very brief
passing, as, for instance, I met a group that had come to Dallas to play chamber
music. They were all from Soviet Armenia, and talked with these people. That
was a year ago. But if there were any other contacts they were of that sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you, in these long tedious days that we have had with you,
pretty well exhausted all of your contacts with any native Russians or any
Russians who were naturalized Americans, and indicated the character of your
contacts with them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are perfectly free to add any others, if you wish.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't think of any particular contact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would it be a fair summary on my part to say that your contact
with these people had been largely either in connection with your interest in
the Quaker Friends groups and their activities, and your work in furthering
their activities, your avid interest in the study of and improvement of your
command of the Russian language and then your contacts with Marina Oswald
and Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would say it was mostly the latter. I met very few native Russians
through my interest in Friends, but through being interested in Russian
there were a good many native Russians at the Middlebury College, for instance,
and the Berlitz teachers have to speak natively whether or not they were born
in Russia, so that these would be my contacts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your pen pal correspondent in Russia, at least the second one,
was Nina Atarina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Aparina, A-p-a-r-i-n-a.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she is the school teacher?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you haven't heard from her in, did you say, 6 or 8 months?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It would be a year, I am quite certain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, in your own words would you tell us something about
your father and mother, your family generally, their interests? Put it in your
own words. We are just trying to supply a background.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can start most easily with their present activities. My mother
has just completed work for a bachelor of divinity from Oberlin College in Ohio.
She has already been ordained as a minister of the Unitarian Church. She
hopes to do work as a chaplain in a hospital, and toward that end has 6 more
weeks training to complete in inservice training in a hospital. My father is
working for a Nationwide Insurance Co. He has been on special assignment
from them to&mdash;I am not certain of the name of the organization&mdash;to cooperative
alliance in Europe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is a cooperative alliance of insurance companies?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Having to do with insurance; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Insurance companies?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; that is my understanding.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is a commercial activity, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I believe so. <span class="locked">And&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me. The cooperative alliance in Europe, does that include
any Iron Curtain countries?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. He is presently teaching a course at Ohio State University,
and is on loan for that portion of time which he occupies with teaching from
his regular job at Nationwide, although he is at the company most of the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is the subject he is teaching?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It has to do with insurance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You start out at the end rather than the beginning, Mrs. Paine.
We don't want to go too far back, but let's go back to your high school days.
Was your father an <span class="locked">insurance&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He worked for the same company then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The same company, in Columbus, Ohio?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have your parents had any interests in political matters?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. Most of that interest I absorbed from hearing it told
about, rather than being around when it was going on. Most of the activity
was in New York and, as I have said, I moved 2 weeks after I was born from
New York. But they have always been interested in what is called the cooperative
movement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell me what you <span class="locked">understand&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My understanding is that the consumer owns the business. In
other words, holds the shares, the stock that control, and determine the management
of the business, and share in the profits.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that something like what I would call a farmers cooperative?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know what farmers cooperative is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you describe what you understand the cooperative movement
is?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think consumers cooperative is somewhat different. I am not
certain what farmers cooperative is. I know that they were interested in
and voted for Norman Thomas when they were in New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you ever had any interests of that nature, that is an
active political interest in a political party? For example, the Socialist Party
of which Mr. Thomas was the head, or leader?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it from this thumbnail sketch of your life up to the
present moment, your interests were largely in the Friends and recreation for
underprivileged children, people who needed help. Your interests were in the
social area, but not a political party interest.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is a correct statement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How would you describe your family from the standpoint of their
social standing or their financial standing? Were they people of modest means?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. My family was middle income who spent rather more
money on education and good medical care than most people in our income.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And they were modest in their tastes, I gather this, frankly, from
reading the correspondence between your parents and yourself. I mean modest
in their material tastes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, yes; and certainly the means were modest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I gather from reading some of the letters and some of the reports
of interviews with others, and may I say to you, Mrs. Paine, that the people
with whom you have been in contact over the years think very well of you,
and particularly your activities in connection with the Friends and your teaching
and recreation, would you say that the pattern of your life has been one of
seeking to help others and of the giving of yourself to others in that respect?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I think that is a fair statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you be good enough, if I am not pressing you too much,
to indicate what your philosophy of life is in that general connection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I believe in doing as the soul prompts, and proceeding to help
or offer help if the desire to do so comes from within me. It is not an ideology
that I am following here, but a desire to live the best possible life I can, and
to always seek to understand what that best life is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you finished?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have a lot of thoughts about the problems of helping anyone,
and about the possibility of self-deception or false pride that can enter, if you
help someone because you think you should or from something outside an
inner feeling that this is what you want to do. But I don't think I have to
discuss it more fully than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Return a moment to your conference with Mr. Hosty, on the first
of November 1963. You have had time to search your own mind as to whether
it occurred actually on the first of November, and what time of the day it was
Marina testified, and this is for the purpose of refreshing your recollection if it
does&mdash;I will read it back a little bit, she was shown Lee's diary and the entry
to which we called your attention yesterday in that diary. She was asked, "Did
you report to your husband the fact of this visit November 1 with the FBI agent?"</p>

<p>She responded: "I didn't report it to him at once, but as soon as he came
for a weekend I told him about it."</p>

<p>Then she added voluntarily: "By the way, on that day he was due to arrive&mdash;that
is November 1.</p>

<p>Mr. Rankin said: "That is on November 1?"</p>

<p>She said: "Yes."</p>

<p>She said, "Lee comes off work at 5:30, comes from work at 5:30. They left
at 5 o'clock," meaning the agents, "and we told them if they wanted they could
wait and Lee would be here soon, but they didn't want to wait."</p>

<p>Does that refresh your recollection in that connection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It may certainly have happened that way. My recollection
stands as I told it yesterday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That it was more toward the middle of the afternoon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, 3:00 or 3:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you advise them, or do you have a recollection of having
advised them that he was expected later that day for the weekend?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I only recall that I said he came on weekends or would be available
to be seen here at my home, in other words, on weekends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She also has a recollection that at this particular visit there
was only one agent rather than two.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is my recollection, also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is your recollection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that was Mr. Hosty?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It could have been, Mrs. Paine, but your recollection doesn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
serve you sufficiently at the moment, that Mr. Hosty was advised on the occasion
of that conference that Lee Oswald was expected that particular weekend?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It could have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. That is, you don't want to take issue with Marina's testimony?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, I don't; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It possibly could have happened that way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It certainly could have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But, in any event, you do remember clearly and distinctly that
you advised Mr. Hosty that Lee did visit on weekends and that Mr. Hosty could
return the next weekend or even this particular weekend to see Lee Oswald
if he wished?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In any event, you further advised him at that time that he was
employed at the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did indeed. May I interrupt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Could we have a short break?</p>

<p>(Brief recess.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During the course of the interview on November 1, was there
any reference to Lee's having passed out leaflets for the FPCC?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was there any inquiry as to whether Lee was engaging in
or had engaged or was engaging in similar activity in the Dallas-Irving-Fort
Worth area?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was reference to it, I suppose in the nature of an inquiry.
I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does this refresh your recollection that Marina said through
you that Lee was not engaging in such activities in the Dallas-Irving-Fort
Worth area?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That seems correct to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Marina was present, was she, at a subsequent interview on the
5th of November?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; she was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was not? She likewise describes the November 1 interview
similarly as you did, that it was in the nature of a conversation rather than an
interview. That was your impression, was it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did your brother ever engage in any political activity?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall it offhand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your sister, Sylvia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or her husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. I am sure they all vote when the opportunity affords.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, yes; of course.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. But you don't mean that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I don't mean that. I mean active political party activity of
some kind.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't have any specific recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you never did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is your brother a member of the American Civil Liberties Union?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or your sister?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is your sister active as you are or a member of the League of
Women Voters?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your relations with your mother and your father&mdash;would you
say you were rather close to your father and your mother?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, I am close to both of them. I am particularly close to my
mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is that likewise true of your brother and your sister, you
have a close relation with your folks?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think I have the closest relation to my mother, and possibly my
brother and sister-in-law, who are near in Ohio, are closer to my father, and
I just can't say as to my sister's relationship, meaning I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The relationships between yourself, your brother, your sister,
your mother and your father, you are compatible? You are interested in each
other's activities?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you exchange correspondence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We do, and photographs of the children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have a lively interest in what each is doing, and they
in you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that has always been true, has it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And do you exchange your troubles and your interests with each
other?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. When we visit. We are, none of us, terribly good letterwriters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From what I have seen I would take exception. I think you
are too modest. There has been a good deal of letterwriting.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There has been a good deal of correspondence over the years; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And at least until recently, I don't know if you still do it, you
were inclined to retain the originals of that correspondence and also copies of
your letters, were you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. For a goodly portion of the correspondence; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I have, which I will mark only for identification, three file
cases of correspondence of your themes or writings in college. You might be
better able to describe what is in these boxes than I in the way of general
summary. Would you do so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It also includes information helpful to me in recreation leadership,
games, something of songs. It includes a list of the people to whom I
sent birth announcements, things of that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It covers a span of years going back to your college days?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And a few papers prior to college.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I have marked these boxes for identification numbers 457, 458,
and 459. During my meeting with you Wednesday morning, I exhibited the
contents of those boxes to you, and are the materials in the boxes other than
material which is printed or is obviously from some other source that which
purports to be in your handwriting, actually in your handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And those pieces of correspondence which purport to be letters
from your mother, your father, your brother, and your sister are likewise the
originals of those letters?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the copies of letters which purport to be letters from you
to your mother, father, sister, and brother, and in some instances others are
copies of letters that you dispatched?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Back on the record, please.</p>

<p>We asked you yesterday if you loaned any money to Marina or to Lee Oswald,
and your answer was in the negative.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We asked you if you had given any money to either of them, and
your answer was in the negative, that is, cash.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I gave no cash.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You gave no cash to either. What do you know about expenditures
by Lee Oswald for such items as bus fare from Dallas to Irving and from
Irving back to Dallas while looking for employment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recall taking him to the bus station once and picking him up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
once. There may have been another occasion, but my specific recollection is as
to these two times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just those two times? You already told us about the time he
went to New Orleans, he bought two bus tickets and then he cashed in one. That
was in the spring.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was in late April.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The same question with respect to telephone calls. You have
already told us that was not a toll call from Dallas to Irving.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he make telephone calls while he was at your home at any
time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Nothing except this one I have mentioned, the time and
temperature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What recollection did you have with respect to this purchasing
of food for meals and whatnot either in New Orleans, Dallas, or in Irving?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In New Orleans he purchased all the food that we used while
there. In Irving, then after October 4 I saw him buy a few items for the baby
or for June, things that Marina had requested, but no groceries.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now the same question with respect to clothing for himself, for
Marina, and for June and Rachel. You have told us about the one instance in
which he gave Marina some money to buy shoes for June, which <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, the shoes were for Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were for Marina, and this had occurred during the week of
the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Our plan was to go out on Friday afternoon, the 22d of November,
to buy these shoes. Just when he gave her the money, I am not certain.
And these, of course, were not bought. I can think of nothing that was bought.
Yes, one thing. When she was with me in the spring, late April to the 9th of
May, she had some money from Lee for her own expenses, and she used a portion
of this, I would think a rather large portion, buying a pair of maternity shorts,
or they may have been Bermuda shorts, longer than that, slacks, even, possibly,
but I know they cost nearly $5, and this was quite a large expenditure and
quite a thrill. These were bought in Irving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it your impression that they had or at least that Marina
was afforded very limited funds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is distinctly my impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They never paid you anything, in any event?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, the same question with respect to laundry. That would be
his laundry largely. I take it from your telling us about you and Marina hanging
up clothes in your backyard on the 22d of November that neither you nor
she ever sent any laundry out for cleaning or washing.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; and Lee brought his underwear and shirts to be washed at
my house, and then Marina ironed his things and he would take clean things with
him on Monday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So that as far as you recall, he made no expenditures for laundry?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At least during the time that Marina was with you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. At least during the fall; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any expenditures on his part to have his hair cut, that is, any
expenditures to the barber, to a barber?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I guess there must have been such. I don't recall it having been
mentioned. I certainly wasn't around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We did ask you yesterday something about some local barber who
seemed to think that Lee had called regularly on Fridays or Saturday morning at
the barber shop. Your impression of that is that that was not Lee who did that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is my impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In any event, you don't recall him ever buddying with or having
a 14-year-old boy with whom he went around while he was in Irving?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I certainly do not recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would your recollection be to the contrary, that he did not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My recollection is distinctly to the contrary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, do you recall that he ever purchased any records, that is
playing records, songs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I recall no such.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The purchase of camera film and the development of camera
film?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are aware from reports of Marina's testimony that she
took some pictures of him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I read in the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any picturetaking during the period, during the fall
of 1963, either in New Orleans or in Irving or in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not by either Lee or Marina that I heard of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you hear any conversation between them in your
presence or with you with respect to his or they having a snapshot camera or
other type of camera to take pictures?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; the only reference to a camera was made by Lee when he
held up and showed me a camera he had bought in the Soviet Union and said
he couldn't buy film for it in this country, it was a different size.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did they ever exhibit any snapshots to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; a few snapshots taken in Minsk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But no snapshots of any scenes in America that they had taken?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or people?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is your impression as to whether Lee gave Marina any
fixed or regular sum of money, by the week or the month?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. When she was with me, she received no such regular sum of
money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you now told us all you can recall as to funds given by Lee
to Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is Hutch's Market&mdash;is that something familiar to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that a local grocery store or delicatessen store?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In Irving?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall an occasion when Lee took Marina to Hutch's
Market to purchase some groceries?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall such an occasion. I do recall that Marina and I,
or perhaps it was only I went in and bought milk there. I think this was on
our way to my house on the 24th of April. But it is not the store I usually go
to, and I am quite certain it is&mdash;it is too far to walk&mdash;I am quite <span class="locked">certain&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How far away is the place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It would be a 3-minute drive&mdash;about 10 blocks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Ten blocks away?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it further away than <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Than the market of which you spoke where you took Lee <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is a little closer than that but blocks in Irving are not well
defined, I might say, so it is hard to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When Lee came to your home on weekends, did he eat all of his
meals there at your home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I have already questioned you about breakfast. He always had
his breakfast at your home but it consisted primarily of merely a cup of coffee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He would eat a sweet roll if there was one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On occasion did he pack a lunch?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I remember one occasion when Marina packed a lunch or packed
some food for him to take.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you say there was anything regular about that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any effort on her part to prepare a packet of lunch for him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You recall only that one occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he ever discuss any finances in your presence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have already testified that we once in New Orleans, in September,
discussed where he had worked and how to establish his residence
in Texas. This involved giving me the remaining portion from a paycheck
from the place where he had worked, and he discussed how much he was earning
per hour at the two places he worked, the three places he worked when I knew
him. But beyond that, I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you told us all the discussions that occurred between you
and Marina with respect to their financial position and their finances and
finances generally?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know what the busfare is from Dallas to Irving?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will exhibit to you transcripts of three letters that you wrote
your mother, which she permitted an agent of the FBI to copy.</p>

<p>I am going to mark those three transcripts Exhibit 461 for identification.</p>

<p>They appear as pages 14, 15, and 16 of a report of agents Wilson and Anderson,
dated December 4, 1963.</p>

<p>(The documents referred to were marked "Ruth Paine Exhibit 461," for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The first of those is a "Dear Mom" letter dated September 30.
I take it that was September 30, 1963. Perhaps I should go at it this way.
Do you recall that letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recall that letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was it in 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I wish to call your attention to a couple portions of the letter
and ask you a question or two.</p>

<p>In the second paragraph which I have underlined for my notes it reads:</p>

<p>"He has been out of work"&mdash;I will read the whole paragraph.</p>

<p>"To my surprise Lee was willing for Marina to come here to have the baby."</p>

<p>That is Irving, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. "Even grateful." Then you say, "He has been out of work since
August, and their income was $33 a week unemployment compensation, not much."</p>

<p>Now, this letter was written from where and followed what event?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This was written from Irving on September 30, and it followed
our arrival in Irving on the 24th of September.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. From New Orleans. I had forgotten that I had heard the sum
or the amount of money he was receiving in unemployment compensation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But this does not refresh your recollection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It does?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It refreshes my recollection that my mother has shown me the
same letter. I registered the same surprise then. I had quite forgotten that sum.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, in the next paragraph it says:</p>

<p>"But I feel now that he does want to keep his family together, and will
send for them as soon as possible."</p>

<p>That was your feeling at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It certainly was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. After New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you will notice in the letter, you say: "I spoke both to Lee
and to Marina of my expectation that you would be here February to June.
Lee asked how this would affect Marina's tenure, and I said she can have a place
as long as they have need for it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now was there, then, at that time, a feeling or expectation
that Marina would remain with you possibly for some considerable period of
time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had not that feeling, as is shown by what is written in the
above sentence, that he will send for his family as soon as possible. However,
I had made it clear that I was willing for her to stay if that was necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So that the text of that letter was not intended by you to
convey the impression that you then expected at least at that time and that
Lee also might have expected and Marina, also, that she would be at your
home for any considerable period of time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did not expect that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As to your expectation&mdash;was that dependent on his securing
employment and sending for her, and at that time both of you, meaning
Marina and yourself, expected that when he obtained work he would send for
Marina and they would be together again?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, the second letter, which is dated October 15, 1963, and
apparently at your home, it says 2575, it is 2515, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. West 5th Street&mdash;and it is also a "Dear Mom" letter. Would
you look at that and see if you did dispatch that letter to your mother?</p>

<p>For the record, Mr. Reporter, this present letter commences in the middle of
page 15 of this document.</p>

<p>Do you recall the letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you report the fact the big news as of that day, that Lee
had obtained a position.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that his position with the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't mention the place of work in your letter.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You go on to say in the second paragraph of the letter:</p>

<p>"It is likely that Marina will stay on here for some time, perhaps through
Christmas or New Year's anyway, with Lee coming weekends as he has the
past two."</p>

<p>Had there been some change now that even though he had a position with
the Texas School Book Depository, that Marina's joining him was being
deferred?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think that is clear in the next sentence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right; read the next sentence.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. "He has a room in Dallas at $8 a week currently, that he'd like
to save a bit before getting an apartment, I think, and, of course, Marina should
be here until she has rested some from childbirth."</p>

<p>We talked for some time of her being there both up to the birth of the baby
and then for a time after so that I could help her with the care of the house,
and with June.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have an expectation that that stay might be on into
the following year?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1964?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I notice you say in the last paragraph of this particular letter:
"I have mentioned to Marina that I'd like to have you here in February and
that I have given up the idea of a trailer."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, to me that is an indication that you expected that Marina
might be with you as late as February 1964. Do I misinterpret? In other
words, Mrs. Paine, you were considering the possible difficulties that might
arise from the fact that you were expecting your mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You hoped she might join you in February of 1964, and that
Marina might still be with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I feel that mentioning this to Marina was more an indication
that it would be difficult for me to have her after February. I didn't make
mention of this until such time as it was clear to me they could well get an
apartment and support themselves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were thinking in terms that if your mother did come
that it would probably be necessary that Marina join her husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During this period of time, did you have any feeling at all that
Lee was&mdash;there might be an anticipation on his part that he would not rejoin
Marina, or she him, that something might possibly intervene, an action on his
part that would keep them separated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had no such feeling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have a contrary feeling?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had a contrary feeling from both, from each.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Marina talked to me of her hopes that what problems they had
in the marriage would work out, and Lee appeared to me happy when he was
with Marina and June, and glad to see them, and I also felt that Marina remained
somewhat uncomfortable accepting from someone else, that she preferred
the more independent situation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. State?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you had no inkling at all or any feeling, the sense on his part
either directly from him or through Marina that he might not continue in the
position, that is the Texas School Depository or might not continue to live in
the Dallas area?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had no such feeling. My expectation was contrary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you read Commission Exhibit 103, which I have described
as the Mexico letter that you found on your desk secretary, did you have any
feeling after you read that that Lee might have in mind going to Havana or
going back to Russia through Mexico, or some other manner or means?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I really didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you think that letter was by and large something of a figment
of the imagination of Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It seemed to me that a goodly portion of it, the part upon which
I could judge, was false.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The third of the letters that your mother made available appears
on page 16. It is dated October 27. I take it from the context of that letter, it
was written by you on October 27, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you recall sending that letter to your mother?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it was written after the baby Rachel had been born?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>What? It was written some time after the baby had been born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, 7 days. One week, as a matter of fact, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I offer in evidence as Commission Exhibit No. 461 the three letters
which I have identified and which the witness herself has identified as having
been her letters and having been dispatched to her mother.</p>

<p>(The documents heretofore marked for identification as Ruth Paine Exhibit
No. 461, were received in evidence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I don't know if I asked you if the second and third had actually
been dispatched by you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They had all been dispatched by me, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During the period of your contacts with each of the Oswalds,
was there any discussion between them in your presence or with you directly by
either of them respecting his family and members of his family?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I should limit that first to up to November 22, 1963. If so, would
your answer be the same?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what was that discussion? Try and fix the time and
places if any particular discussion stands out.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have already testified to Marina's comment on wishing she
could reach her mother-in-law to announce the baby's coming birth. Marina
also talked to <span class="locked">me&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that Lee did not give her the telephone number or advise
her of means whereby she could reach her mother-in-law?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she indicate to you that he, in turn, had indicated he didn't
wish <span class="locked">her&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She indicated that he did not wish to make contact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did it go beyond that, that he did not wish members of his
family to know that the child Rachel had been born?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not that specifically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Marina told of having stayed with Lee's brother Robert and
Robert's wife in Fort Worth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When they first returned from Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct. And of her sorrow that she hadn't been able to
talk more, having virtually no English, but that she had liked both of them.</p>

<p>I also learned from her that Robert had been assigned by the same company
for which he worked in Fort Worth to a different town, I think in Alabama for
a brief period, and then I heard in October or early November that he had
<span class="locked">been&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; that he had been transferred to Denton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Denton, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Part of the correspondence that I have given to the Commission
contains a reference by Marina to Lee's brother, to the best of my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Brother Robert?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can look that up. It doesn't say. But I assumed so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you aware now that Lee had two brothers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am now aware of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you aware during their contact with you up to November 22,
1963, that he had two brothers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have a vague recollection that Marina had mentioned there
being another brother, but I am not certain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did anything occur in the way of conversation or otherwise
that brought to your attention the fact, if it be a fact, that Lee was avoiding
contact with his brother and his mother?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was under the <span class="locked">impression&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the fall of 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was under the impression that he was not avoiding contact
with his brother, but that he was avoiding contact with his mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you aware during this fall period that he was employing
a post office box, he had rented a post office box and was using it to receive
communications?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At any time during your acquaintance with the Oswalds had anything
been said about his renting a post office box?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was an occasion, I think it must have been after we had
been to the bus station on April 24 that he asked to go by the main post office
in Dallas to pick up some things. That would have implied a post office box
there. But that <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What date was this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. April 24, to the best of my recollection. I can't <span class="locked">think&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recall that I was driving and Lee went into this main post
office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where? In Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In Dallas, and the only time I can think it could have been
was that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he come out with any mail?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Magazines, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you able to observe what those magazines were?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he ever speak of his life as a youth and a young man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or his experiences in the service?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you know or were you aware that he had been in the
service?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. His two large duffels which I saw a number of times said Marine
Corps on them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any discussion of the fact that he had been in the
Marines?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think it had been mentioned. I don't specifically recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But just in passing, not in the sense of his relating any of his
experiences in the Marines?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I do recall one occasion in late October or early November
when Marina said to me in the morning that the two of them had had a long
and very pleasant conversation. Lee related things about his past life, for
instance his having been in Japan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she elaborate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just talked in terms of conclusion, that is, that he had related
these events to her and they had talked about it for some time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The point of her telling me of this was that this was unusual.
He didn't usually reminisce and converse in this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you had a contact with or she with you, a Mrs. Shirley
Martin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Mrs. Shirley Martin came to visit me at my home, accompanied
by her four children, and dog, some time in January&ndash;February, I don't know
just when.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Late January or early February?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would guess so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of this year?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Of 1964; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please relate that incident to us?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She telephoned to ask if she could come out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you known her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had not known her. I had heard her name from the New
York Times correspondent in Dallas, who said he had received a letter from
her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right; proceed.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She came out, told me that she had been in Dallas going over the
route which Lee Oswald is supposed to have taken from the School Book Depository
to his rooming house, and thence to the place where he was arrested, and
she was in a hurry at that point to get back to suburban Tulsa, Okla., but wanted
to ask me a few questions, and I answered whatever she wanted to know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall what her questions were?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't specifically recall; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you had any correspondence with Mrs. Martin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have answered one of her letters by writing in the margin the
answers to the questions that letter posed, and sending the whole thing back
to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So that you do not have a copy of any correspondence with
Mrs. Martin?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She has sent more than one letter. I said I had answered one
and sent it back on that letter. I have perhaps four&mdash;no; perhaps as many as
eight letters from her now that, some are directly typed and some are just
carbons of something she has said to a large group of people. We have also had
some communication by telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May I see those letters when I am in Dallas Monday and
Tuesday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You can certainly see them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you summarize generally what the inquiries of Mrs.
Martin have been and the subject matter and the nature of your responses?
Telephone, or otherwise?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I do recall in the initial visit when she was in my home I asked
her if she thought Lee Oswald was not guilty of the crime he is alleged to have
committed and she said, well, that she couldn't say that, that it would be
foolish at this point in the inquiry to say that, but that she was not satisfied with
the evidence that led to a public conclusion that he was guilty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you express any opinion on your part?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On that subject?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I said that I thought he was guilty of the act.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did not know Mrs. Martin prior to the time she came to your
door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your acquaintance with her in the interim has been limited
to what you have testified?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you are not working with Mrs. Martin in her campaign or
crusade or whatever it may be?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I answer any questions she has just as I do answer questions
of newsmen or other people who wish to inquire about what I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you please give me your impression of Lee Oswald's personality,
what you think made him tick, any foibles of his, your overall impression
now as you have it sitting there of Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My overall impression progressed through several stages.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why don't you give those. I think it would be helpful to us if you
would. Start at the beginning.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In the spring what I knew of him was that he wanted to send his
wife away back to the Soviet Union, which she didn't want to do, that he would
not permit her to learn English or certainly didn't encourage it. I knew that
he had lost his job and looked unsuccessfully. I formed an initial negative
opinion about him, on really very little personal contact. I saw him very briefly
the evening of the 22d of February, the evening of the second of April, and the
afternoon of the 20th of April, and again on the 24th of April and so as far as I
remember that is virtually all of the contact I had had directly with him.</p>

<p>And this impression stayed with me throughout the summer and throughout
my visits to various friends and family on my trip of August and September 1963,
and I undoubtedly conveyed to the people I talked to during that time that
impression, which I carried at that time.</p>

<p>When I saw him again in New Orleans, beginning the 20th of September, I was
impressed quite differently.</p>

<p>He seemed friendly. He seemed grateful, as reported in this letter to my
mother, even grateful that I was offering to have his wife in my home and help
her make arrangements at Parkland Hospital to have the baby there, at a fee
adjusted to their income. He appeared to me to be happy, called cheerily to
Marina and June as he came in the house with a bag full of groceries. He, as I
described, washed the dishes that evening that Marina and I went down to
Bourbon Street. And particularly in parting on the morning of September 23
I felt he was really sorry to see them go. He kissed them both at the house as we
first took off and then again when we left from the gas station where I had
bought a tire.</p>

<p>And I felt, as expressed in this letter that you just showed me to my mother
that he hoped to have his family together again as soon as he could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
Then, of course, the impression enlarged as I saw him in my home on the
weekends beginning October 4, and I have read into the record one letter I wrote
to my mother during that period, which shows that he tried to be helpful around
the house, that he played with my children, that he, it appeared to me, was becoming
more relaxed and less fearful of being rejected, and I had sensed in him
this fear earlier. It was because I had sensed in him in the spring this insecurity
and feelings of inadequacies that the thought once crossed my mind as expressed
to Mrs. Rainy that he could be guilty of a crime of passion if he thought someone
was taking away from him his wife, something valuable to him. Clearly he
valued Marina. She was his only human contact, really, and I think <span class="locked">while&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. His only human contact?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Really, so far as I could see, the only friend he had, and while
he did quarrel and was petty with her on many times that I saw, he, I felt,
valued her, and, of course, it is also true, as I have reported, that I never saw
him physically violent to her or cruel, so that my impression of him, which I
carried with me throughout my trip during the summer, changed, and my
impression of him up to the <span class="locked">time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Of the assassination, was of a struggling young man who wanted
to support his family, who was having difficulty, who wanted to achieve something
more in life than just the support of his family and raising children, who
was very lonely, but yet could meet socially with people and be congenial when
he made efforts to be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that effort confined largely to his immediate family?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I recall <span class="locked">specifically&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And to you and your children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And I think I told you this, but that it is not in the record, that
Mrs. Ruth Kloepfer with her two daughters&mdash;no; I mentioned that to the record&mdash;came
over to their house in New Orleans in September, and he was a
genial host on that occasion, and he was, I felt, enjoying being the center of
interest for four or five people at this initial party when I first met him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was in the spring? That was February of 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right; so that it is in this period when he was coming out weekends
in the fall to my home that he seemed to me a man striving, wanting to
achieve something, a man without much formal schooling nor much native
intelligence, really, but a striver, trying hard, and I never felt any sense during
that period that he might be a violent person or apt to break over from mild
maladjustment to active violent hostility towards an individual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have any feeling or impression that he in turn felt frustrated,
that the ideals and objectives toward which he was reaching were
unattainable, and he was having that feeling that they were unattainable, or
at least that others were not accepting him in the concept in which he regarded
himself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; and I think I have testified <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that fairly distinct in your mind?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it was quite distinct. I don't believe he felt successful.</p>

<p>As I have said, I didn't talk much with him about what his aims were. But
it seemed to me, and Marina expressed to me her feeling, that he had an overblown
opinion of himself, and of what he could and should achieve in the world.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is your impression of him as his being introspective or an
introvert or an extrovert? Did he seek friends or did he avoid social contact?
What are your impressions in those areas of him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would say that he was a combination, that the man within was
an introvert, preferred the company of the television set or a book, but that
he could, as I have said, be a genial host or go to a meeting of the American
Civil Liberties Union with my husband, and I understand that he made a fairly
good impression upon some of the people there.</p>

<p>And I have also heard that he was making a fairly good impression where
he was working at this last place.</p>

<p>Further, it is not the sign of an introvert to blow off on little things to your
wife, as he did. I felt that he exercised the safety valve of expressing
irritations early. He didn't save them up. They came right out. I might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
say, also, I felt that he was primarily an emotional person, though he talked of
ideology and philosophy, that what moved him and what reached him were the
more emotional qualities of life, and that he was really unusually sensitive to
hurt.</p>

<p>Now, some of this is hindsight, and I would like to label it as such, but I want
to say that I was not at all surprised reading after the assassination that he
took a little puppy to his favorite teacher as a gift, and then came over to see
this puppy very often. This was in the fourth grade or so. As an effort to
make a warm contact and show feeling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is, if this incident did in fact take place, it was something
that you could understand?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Understand in the sense that it might be <span class="locked">something&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In terms of what I saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That Lee Oswald would have done, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. As a child.</p>

<p>I did feel that very likely he took fewer and fewer risks making friends as
he grew up than he perhaps had as a child, but I was guessing at that, the risk
of being close, in other words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Took fewer and fewer risks?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think he was fearful of being close to anyone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or being hurt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Because he could, therefore, be hurt, right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Not being accepted?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. If he allowed himself to be friends or be close, then he opened
the possibility of the friend hurting him, and I had this feeling about him, that
he couldn't permit or stand such hurt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you tell us of your feelings toward Marina? You liked
her? That is what I am getting at.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I like her very much. I felt always that what I wanted
to say and what I was able to understand of what she said was hampered by
my poor Russian. It improved a good deal while with her, and we did have
very personal talks about our respective marriages.</p>

<p>But I felt this was just a developing friendship, not one in full bloom, by any
means. I respected what I saw in her, her pride, her wish to be independent,
her habit of hard work, and expecting to work, her devotion to her children,
first to June and then to both of the little girls, and the concentration of her
attention upon this job of mother, and of raising these children.</p>

<p>I also respected her willingness and effort to get on with Lee, and to try to
make the best of what apparently was not a particularly good marriage, but
yet she had made that commitment and she expected to do her best for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is your present reaction, and even as you went along, of
her feeling or regard for or with respect to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I felt she liked me. I felt she tended to put me in a position of
Aunt Ruth, as she called me, I have already said, to Junie, almost as aunt to
her rather than a mother as she was equal, in other words, she was a young
mother and I was a young mother equal in age and stage in life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By the way, you were of her age, were you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I am older than she. I am 31.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are 31 and she is what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Twenty-two. But our children were fairly close in age, and our
immediate problems were fairly similar therefore.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now; would you give me your reaction to Robert?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have very little reaction to Robert, of course, having met him
only at the police station and said very little to him there, and equally little
when he came with Mr. Thorne and Mr. Martin to pick up Marina's things at
my house a few weeks after the assassination. That is the sum total of my
contact, so that what impressions I have have been formed from what people
said and not directly formed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In other words, you had so little contact with him that you really
have formed no particular opinion with respect to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have any impression at all or any knowledge, if you have
knowledge, of his impressions of you and of your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I have no knowledge of his impressions of me or my husband.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And do you have any impressions apart from knowledge?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I have some impressions about what Mr. Thorne and Mr.
Martin are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What are they? Who are the two men you mentioned&mdash;Mr.
Martin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Mr. Martin acted as business advisor for Marina and she lived
at his home for some time after the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have some contact with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I met him on the 21st of December at his home, came to the
door and he recognized and asked me in. I don't know I had met him before
because I didn't know he had been one of the men who had come with Robert
to pick up the things for Marina, but he said he had been on that occasion.</p>

<p>(Brief recess.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We were talking about Mr. Martin. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We had a short but fairly cordial talk and I left with him a
package of letters that had come to my address but were really for Marina,
containing notes and checks of donations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did you become aware of what the contents of those were?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They were addressed to me in my name, so that I opened them
and then these were enclosing a check asking me to deliver it to Marina, this
sort of thing.</p>

<p>And also brought, I can't remember, some items, things I found in the house
that belonged to her very probably that we hadn't noticed when Robert had
come to get the remaining items.</p>

<p>From a call to the Secret Service headquarters in Dallas I had gained the
impression that I shouldn't try to see Marina Oswald at that time, and while
I was under the impression that she was at Mr. Martin's home it was not my
particular intention to see her.</p>

<p>I wanted to meet him if I could and learn anything that would give me some
more impression of how things were going for her at that time, and with this
small collection of donations for her that I was taking, I wrote a short note
to her, a Christmas greeting, and returned home.</p>

<p>I came&mdash;perhaps I should interrupt here.</p>

<p>Talking about my contact with Mr. Martin and Mr. Thorne is really best done
in connection with the letters I wrote to Marina, and these are&mdash;since the assassination,
and these are in Irving. It might be better to do the whole thing as
part of the deposition there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When I come to Irving this coming week?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What feeling do you have as to the reason why, if you have
any at all, there appears to have been this sudden, if it is sudden, at least lack
of contact between you and Marina commencing with the last time you saw her
some 10 days or 2 weeks ago? When was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The morning of the 23d of November.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have had no contact with or from her from the 23d
to some 10 days or 2 weeks ago, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You recall I said that I had talked with her by phone the evening
of the 23d and then again around noon of the 24th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Then there was one call from her to me, telephone call from the
motel where she was staying for a couple of weeks after the assassination. It
was brief, but she expressed her gratitude to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Her gratitude for what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. For things that I had done, for having had her at my home. I
said, either said or she asked that Michael was staying at my home now, and
she said, "Well, maybe something good can come of even this terrible thing."
I said that I was writing an article with a fellow for Look Magazine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is the article we put in evidence yesterday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; and she expressed her feeling that that was a good thing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
really her feeling that she hoped I might get some financial remuneration from
it. I think she always felt terribly indebted to me in a way she couldn't
resolve. I said I had talked by telephone with Mrs. Ford the previous day.
This telephone call between myself and Mrs. Ford was the first time she and I
had talked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The first time you and Mrs. Ford had talked?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; and Mrs. Ford called me. And I had taken Mrs. Ford's
number that day, and gave this number to Marina over the phone. Mrs. Ford
and I had talked about whether Marina should be encouraged herself to write
something just from the aspect of her financial need, and that this might ease
the finances, and I was hopeful that Mrs. Ford, more fluent in Russian than I,
would help Marina in a decision relative to this matter. Marina said to me,
"They don't know that I'm telephoning you."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They don't know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is all she said, and I didn't know to whom the "they" referred.
But, because of that, I did not mention to the press or to friends that
she had called, with the exception of Michael, feeling that in time she would
certainly contact me again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Has she?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, she wrote me a Christmas card with a few sentences on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We have that in evidence, have we?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, no; that is part of the postcorrespondence I didn't suppose
you cared about. You can pick that up in Irving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May I see it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, you certainly may see it, and I'll translate it for you.</p>

<p>The card conveys greetings to me and my family for Christmas, thanked me
again for all my generosity. I felt overthanked because I didn't feel I had
done very much. And said she was sorry that our friendship had ended so badly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She said this in the note? The answer is yes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The answer is yes. And I was surprised and a little hurt at the
implication of its being over. I have already said that I went out to Robert
Oswald's home in an effort to inquire of him and his wife what my best role
might be as a friend towards Marina, or trying to express friendship to Marina
at this time. I felt that possibly she was being advised not to contact me or
that it was more difficult for the Secret Service to keep her location unknown if
I had any contact with her or that they thought so at least. In fact, of course,
I knew where she was anyway. And I also recalled something I will put in here
that occurred as we were watching the television set after it was announced that
the President was shot. I said, "and it happened in our city. I am going to
move back east." And she knew, of course, not only because of this statement
but because of the many things I have done which I have reported at that time
that I was terribly grieved at Kennedy's death. And I wondered if she wouldn't
possibly feel that I couldn't forgive her for simply being the wife of the accused
assassin. So that I wanted to somehow convey to her that I didn't hold her
guilty or carry any animosity toward her. And in the situation I just didn't
know how to convey this. What I did was to write her letters talking about
normal things, but requesting a reply, and I didn't get a reply.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You did not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have a feeling that left uninfluenced and free to do as
she might wish to do, that Marina is still friendly with you and regards you
well and would be in contact with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have a feeling that left uninfluenced, she would have certainly
remained friendly to me. If she suddenly now became uninfluenced, and perhaps
she has become uninfluenced, it doesn't erase a period of influence that
may have affected and may continue to affect her feelings toward me. I don't
know what she has said or what was suggested about me to her, and we didn't
get into anything of this nature at the one brief meeting on March 9. I didn't
feel it appropriate. But a lot has passed. She was, after all&mdash;it has already
been longer that I have not seen her, had no contact with her during a very trying
and significant period in her life. That period was longer than the whole period
she stayed with me. So much has happened, and I just don't know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you visited her on March 9, was it at her present home in
Richardson, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. I had asked Mrs. Ford if I could come and make a tape recording
at her house with her reading a Russian beginning reader text onto the
tape so that I could use this to improve my pronunciation and to use it with my
one Russian student, and she said she would be glad to help me with that
recording, glad to help any time when someone wanted to learn Russian. We
neither one could do it that week, but she called me back a week later and said
that she thought it would be nice if Marina made the recording, since <span class="locked">Marina&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was volunteered on the part of Mrs. Ford?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This was volunteered on the part of Mrs. Ford and she suggested
that I come to her house on March the 9th and we would go from her house to
Marina's house and make a recording and, of course, I was pleased with the
opportunity to see Marina whether or not it involved making a recording that
night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. This was at night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was in the evening; yes. As it turned out, we stayed at Mrs.
Ford's. We did not go to Marina's house. Marina said to <span class="locked">me&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Marina was at Mrs. Ford's when you arrived?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Was at Mrs. Ford's when I arrived and we stayed there the
entire time during the visit. Marina explained she didn't have her furniture yet
in her house and she would like to wait and invite me when she had her own
home as she wanted it, and this, I think, is quite accurate. She likes things to
look nice. I think she was pleased to have a home of her own.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you girls have a general conversation apart from your immediate
objective of having a recording?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We had primarily a nice visit. We did then do a recording, also.
As it turned out, Mrs. Ford did the reading, because Marina really needed to
take care of June, who was there, also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was your impression of Marina at that time that she was
friendly or at least that she was not averse?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. She was friendly. She said she was fearful that I might
be angry with her for her not having answered my letters, and by making reference
to the content of several of the letters I answered my own unspoken question
as to whether she had received them. She had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She has?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She recognized each of those things to which I referred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Things she mentioned during the course of this meeting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Indicated that she had received my letters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; indicated to you that she had received them.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; and she said she was fearful that I would be angry with
her for not having answered. But she said that Mr. Martin had advised her not
to write to me or reply, and that she hoped I had understood that something of
this nature was affecting her, and that this was why she was not writing. I
asked about the change from having Thorne as a lawyer and Martin as a business
advisor, to Mr. McKenzie as a lawyer, and she thought that was a good and
necessary change, was relieved that this was being done. I said that I had
talked with Mr. Thorne.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was the first Friday or Saturday in January.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of this year?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Of 1964, and I asked him whether she, whether Marina, had
delegated power of attorney to anyone, and Mr. Thorne told me no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why did you make that inquiry?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Why did I make that inquiry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. At that time? I was concerned. I had no idea what sort of men
these were or what arrangements they had made, and it seemed to me I had
heard that Thorne had told me himself that he conducted all his business with
Marina in English, and I thought this cannot be very detailed, because I knew
her English to be quite poor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you troubled about her understanding of what was being
done?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was troubled about her understanding of what she had signed,
and I wanted to know what powers she had delegated to someone else. Therefore,
I asked specifically about power of attorney, and he told me, no, she had
not delegated that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have a sense of responsibility in this area?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But this was not mere curiosity or meddling on your part?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I felt that it was possible that she was being protected from her
friends, and that had no <span class="locked">one&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean isolated from her friends?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All right; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you really mean that, isolated rather than protected from?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, that someone may have thought she should not talk to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And, further, I learned that she hadn't spoken at an earlier time,
at that time, to Mrs. Ford. I did not know of anyone who spoke Russian except
for official translators for Secret Service or the FBI who had been to see her, and
this seemed to me wrong. So I was concerned. And when I reported this conversation
with Mr. Thorne to Marina, she said, "Well, that is a lie" and I
<span class="locked">said&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She <span class="locked">said&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is a lie. She had delegated power of attorney, and I knew
that at this time I was reporting the conversation to Marina on the 9th of March
because I had read it in the paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had learned it in the meantime?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Had learned in the meantime that she had delegated power of
attorney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I have been seeking all that occurred in your visit with Marina
and Mrs. Ford in the Ford home on March 9. Have you completed that? Is
there anything you would like to add?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I would like to add that Mrs. Ford was out for a brief
period. She went to the washerteria to pick up some clothes that had been
at the drier so that for a time Marina and I were alone perfectly free to say
anything we wanted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And during that period was your conversation, your visit with
Marina pleasant?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, indeed; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Free and open? What reaction did you get during the period
you were alone with her as to her feeling or regard or how she felt about you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I felt she was certainly friendly, but I felt the strain of
wanting to avoid any reference to her husband or to the events that were so
painful to us both. And I didn't want to ask directly anything about why she
hadn't written or confront her with that. She did say as I was working at the
tape recorder later, and Mrs. Ford was reading from the book, we came to a
break in the recording and Marina commented, she had been sitting across the
room watching, my profile was very like her mother's, and this is not the first
time she has made the connection to my physical build and that of her mother.
I don't give this much significance, but I do have the impression that there are
many feelings and mixed feelings in us both. It is not a simple relationship.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you anticipate the possibility of, I will use the word, renewing,
it may not be the right word.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think that would be right. There has been a distinct break.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of this cordial friendship and relationship with Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would like that if it comes about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And do you have a feeling that there is a possibility of that
arising out of your contact with her on March 9, having now talked with her
face to face?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think there is that possibility. I would like her to do some
of the initiating, if not most of it at this point. I said I was going to Washington.
I had just heard that same evening before going to the Fords. Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
Ford said that she and her husband were to go to Washington, and when.
And I said when I would be back home, and Marina implied that she might try
to contact me then. I am hopeful that she will. I don't have any particular
plans to attempt to contact her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have any feeling other than charity in your heart for
Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, yes; certainly. I like her very much as a person. This
doesn't mean that I understand her, that she is a person to whom I feel automatically
kindred. She was raised in Soviet Russia. She has a background
very foreign to my own. I am not even aware of some of the kinds of differences
this may cause. I do think that she is a good thinker and a free thinker
and that she thinks for herself. I was interested to note what I have put into
the record, I believe, yesterday evening about her comment to Mr. Hosty, the
first time he came to the house, that she thought Castro was not getting an
entirely fair press or not being pictured well in this country, to present a contrary
opinion in this situation, and an independent opinion, possibly, clearly
unpopular, or she could well suspect it would be unpopular with the FBI agent
showed a certain amount of independence and courage and self-confidence, I
felt, more what I would expect of an American than of a person raised to be
fearful of secret police and state domination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have anything you want to add in this connection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Just the observation that her view of herself and of what she
should do now that her husband has been accused of assassinating the President
of the United States must be very strongly affected by the fact that she
was raised in Soviet Russia, not here, but the fact that she is an emigre hopeful
of staying, but by no means native.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she ever talk to you, I think you mentioned before that she
was hopeful of staying. Did she express that to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. On several occasions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And of ultimately becoming a citizen of the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She didn't mention that, but I assumed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You assumed it from the nature of the conversation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I didn't hear anything specifically stated about that until
I read it in the paper after the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I would like to limit it first not to what you read in the paper
and your being influenced thereby, but from your contacts with Marina, and the
conversations that you had, there must have been many, many of them.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In your home. Do you have a feeling that she has a hope or
desire or an intention eventually to become a citizen of the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall that specifically. I recall on several occasions that
<span class="locked">she&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am seeking only your impression now.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I will try to answer it by giving these impressions. She expressed
many times her wish to stay in this country. She wanted to raise
her children here. She was interested in June's learning English and was very
concerned that June be able to speak English before she entered school. Indeed,
I felt she was not enough concerned that June maintain a bilingual background.
She wouldn't have cared if June only learned English, whereas, I, here struggling
hard to learn Russian, thought that June could have a chance to learn it
easily, but her expression of interest was in June's learning English and not
any particular desire to maintain a bilingual quality.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I would share your feeling. I wish I had the command of more
than English. I would like very much to do so. I took a lot of Spanish,
but it is completely gone now.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is very hard to be truly bilingual. Few children have the
opportunity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I have just a couple technicalities on the diary and on your
address book, so I can establish them for the record. I would like to go
through Commission Exhibit 401, which is the calendar. The entry on page 3
of the exhibit in reference to Lawrence Hoke&mdash;that is your brother-in-law? Oh,
that is your nephew?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was born last April 14, 1963, and I wrote it down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Nothing to do with the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next sheet is blank, of course. Now, to the calendar itself,
are there any entries in January that have reference to Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. None.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. February?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Pick them out according to dates.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, you must understand that some of these were written at
the time and some were put in later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right; distinguish between them, please.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I wrote down on February 15, June's birthday, 9:55 a.m., Minsk.
That was written in later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is, she was born on February 15. Did you put the year
in there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The year does not appear. I, of course, know it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that was the previous year?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She was born in 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 1962. Any other reference or entry in the month of February
that has relation to the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. At the top is written "Marina last period February 5" crossed
out "or 15th." This refers to menstrual period trying to figure when the
baby would be due, and it was an inaccurate notation I learned later. Then
there is a note written at the time, the only one on this page that refers to
the Oswalds that was written at the time, and that says, "Everett's?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Entered where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. On the 22d of February, and from <span class="locked">this&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have already testified about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. From this I deduced that was when I first met them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I turn to March, and I direct your attention to the upper
left-hand corner of that card, and it appears to me that in the upper left-hand
corner are October 23, then a star, then "LHO" followed by the words
"purchase of rifle." Would you explain those entries?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. This was written after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. After?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This was written indeed after the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I heard on the television that he had purchased a rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I heard it on November 23.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And went back to the page for March, put a little star on
March 20 as being a small square, I couldn't fit in all I wanted to say. I
just put in a star and then referring it to the corner of the calendar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is to the entry I have read?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Put the star saying "LHO purchase of rifle." Then I thought
someone is going to wonder about that, I had better put down the date, and
did, but it was a busy day, one of the most in my life and I was off by a
month as to what day it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is you made the entry October?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. October 23 instead of November.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It should have been November 23?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It should have been November 23.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the entry of October 23, which should have been November
23, was an entry on your part indicating the date you wrote on the calendar
the star followed by "LHO purchase of rifle" and likewise the date you
made an entry?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. On the 20th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is the square having the date March 20?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that correct?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I might point out that I didn't know Lee had a middle name
until I had occasion to fill out forms for Marina in Parkland Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is when you learned that his middle name was Harvey
and his initial was H?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any other entries in March relating to the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Identify it, please, first as to date.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And this written at the time&mdash;it happens to be also on March 20,
it says, "Marina," and I judge that this was the time we had scheduled for me
to come to her, and I believe it is the date referred to in one of the letters as
"until the 20th."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have already testified about this incident?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any others?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not for the month of March.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, dropping down on that same page to the calendar
for April, are there any entries relating to the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. Written at the time there is an entry for Tuesday, April 2,
"Marina and Lee, dinner" and it looks like "7 o'clock" above the word "dinner."
That has been testified to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have testified about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. Then there is an entrance <span class="locked">on&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. An entry?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. An entry, yes, sorry; on April 8 where Marina's name appears,
this time written in Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have testified about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, and there is a similar entrance for the 10th of April with
an arrow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Entry, you mean again?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am sorry, an entry pushing it over to the 11th, which would
indicate to me that the actual meeting took place on the 11th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You testified about that, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, I have. And then I have also testified about meeting, picnic,
Marina and Lee, on the 20th of April.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And then I have also testified about seeing both of them on the
24th of April, and in that square on my calendar appear the words "Lee and
Marina."</p>

<p>Then there was an entry referring to the <span class="locked">Oswalds&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean theirs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Theirs, but written in later, saying, "Marina and Lee Wedding
Anniversary two years ago."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is, you mean you didn't write it on the 30th of April?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I wrote that later. I learned that date some time in the fall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have now identified all entries on the April calendar referring
to the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Let's take May.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I have referred to the fact that this entry on May 1 "Mary"
refers to a babysitter, followed by "War and Peace." This recalls to me the
fact that Marina went with me and we took June and we saw the movie War
and Peace.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About which you have testified?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. The next <span class="locked">entry&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next one relating to the Oswalds.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right, is on May 10 going over to the 11th where in New Orleans
and it means these were the days we were going to New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have testified about that entry and that event?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any other entries on the May calendar relating to the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right; now drop down to June, please.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No entries relating to the Oswalds in June.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Turn the page and go to the calendar for July.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I see an entry on July 17 which says, "Marina birthday." This
was written either before or after I did know in the spring that her birthday
was in July. I am not certain I have got it down on the right date, and that
is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Drop down then to the calendar for August. Are there any
entries relating to the Oswalds on that date?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Turn the page. We have now reached the calendar for September.
Are there any entries relating to the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you identify them, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. On September 23 there is an entry, "A.M. left N.O." meaning
New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is an entry of your having departed from New Orleans to
go back <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And this was written shortly after that event.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To go back to Texas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. On the 24th is written, "Home arrived 1:30 p.m., from N.O."
meaning New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was that entry made?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. These were both made after our arrival back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But shortly afterwards?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Very shortly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you say you had a luncheon engagement?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you like to suspend, and we have lunch and then come
back?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is now 1 o'clock. We will be back at 2.</p>

<p>Could you finish this calendar?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We have finished September. We are up to October 1963. There
is an entry on Friday the 4th that says, "Gave blood" and that has been referred
to in testimony previously.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was in connection with Marina's entry into Parkland
Hospital for the birth of her child?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct. Crossed out on the 7th of October is "Lee birthday?"
On the 18th of October appears an entry "Lee birthday."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had it in the wrong place initially?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And then you put it in the right place eventually?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Then on the 11th there is a notation "Marina appointment PMH" Parkland
Memorial Hospital, "8 a.m." This was our first appointment as I recall, when
we applied for care. There is an entry on October 15, "Work L start." This
was a mistaken entry and it is crossed out, written down after he called to say
he had received work, he didn't actually start working until the 16th, and I have
written on the 16th, "Lee work start," and also "HOS" for hospital, and "10:30
a.m." That would be Parkland. I would be certain it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were those entries made contemporaneously with the occurrence
of the events they seek to record?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All except the corrected, "Lee work start," which was made
after the assassination, when I realized he didn't start work on the same day
that he received the acceptance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How soon after the assassination did you make that corrected
entry?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Quite soon I'd say. I was being asked each day by many people
when did he start to work, and when I put together the necessary sequence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
events of having been at coffee at my neighbors, following by his applying,
following by his starting, it had to be on the 16th that he had started. Then
on the 20th of October is a notation, one word in Russian which says "she was
born." It is followed by "10:41 p.m., 6 pounds 15 ounces."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that refers to Marina's child Rachel?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>On October 22 is a notation, "Baby come home noon" or "came home". That
means exactly what it says.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was it entered contemporaneously with the event?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The entry of the baby's birth, was that entered contemporaneously
with the event?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; right after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Let me say at this moment this calendar, you employed it sometimes
as a diary entry, sometimes as prospective appointments, and sometimes
to record past events after they had occurred?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>On the 29th of October appears the entry, "Dal" short for Dallas "Junie" she
had a clinic appointment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is the child of Lee Harvey, Lee and Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The older daughter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you have turned the page to the calendar for November.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right. You asked me at some time during my testimony
was I away during the weekend for any length of time other than to go to the
grocery store. I had forgotten but I see here a doctor appointment, "Dr.
Liebes," on Saturday would have been made the day before, meaning the child
is sick, or that morning, and it means that I was away for an hour and 15
minutes or an hour and a half.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What day is this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. On Saturday, the 2d of November.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is the weekend as to which you had some difficulty recalling
whether Lee actually visited your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Beginning Friday or beginning Saturday, or possibly he wasn't
out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You recall that the FBI interviewed you on Friday, November 1.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And do you have an entry to that effect?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I did not mark that down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it your recollection that Lee, if he didn't visit or come to
your home on the 1st, that he did come on the 2d?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have no clear recollection.</p>

<p>Then there is an entry on November 6, "9:30 dental clinic Marina", it means
exactly that. We took her to a dental clinic to get dental care.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that was probably an entry made in advance to remind you
that she had a dental appointment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>There is an entry on November 11, "Veterans Day." I have already referred
to the fact that I was away from 9 or so in the morning until about 2 in the
afternoon and this was a day that Lee was at home or at the Fifth Street address
at my home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What date is this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Veterans Day, the 11th. It was a Monday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is a Monday. And he was at home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was at home that day, and I was away from about 9 in the
morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me so we don't get the record confused as to what home
means.</p>

<p>He was at your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. There is an entry on the 14th of November, "8 a.m. June
Oswald." This I recall to be a reference to taking her to a TB clinic. There
was a slight suspicion that she might have been exposed to TB, but this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
followed by an entry on the 21st, "Checked TB test" and at that time it was
clearly negative. She did not have tuberculosis.</p>

<p>In the same connection, there is an entry on the 18th of November, "1 o'clock
TB children's clinic", abbreviation of children's, and I would judge we didn't
go all of those times. One of those probably was changed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall that it was but one TB examination visit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There were two visits. We went and they scratched the skin to
apply the test. Then you go back to have it read. And she also had X-rays
taken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could those double entries indicate that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, there were three entries. She only went twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. Is it possible you might have gone three times?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Have you identified all three entries now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have.</p>

<p>There is an entry on the 20th of November, "Marina 10 a.m. dental clinic"
which is the second dental clinic reference.</p>

<p>There is an entry on the 22d of November "9:15 a.m., Lynn Lollar."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How do you spell Lynn?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. L-y-n-n, which refers to a dental appointment for my daughter
to which I have testified.</p>

<p>There is also in <span class="locked">pencil&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Its significance is that it took you out of the home.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is its significance, yes. That is the only reason it is related.
There is also a penciled note at the bottom of the month that says, "Planned
Parent," arrow up, arrow down, meaning this week or next visit the Planned
Parenthood Clinic, with Marina, for Marina.</p>

<p>This brings us to December.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, that elicits a little curiosity on my part.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or interest, rather, not just bare curiosity, pertinent curiosity,
should I put it that way. What was the purpose of that visit? I am acquainted
with planned parenthood society. What was the purpose of the visit? Was
she concerned about having more children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is exactly it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you relate that and your conversations with her on that
score?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. I might go back and say that in March when she first
mentioned to me she was expecting a child and we talked about birth control,
at that time I also said in March that I would be glad to go with her after the
birth of the baby to the Planned Parenthood Clinic to get advice and necessary
help, so that she could prevent further conceptions if she wished to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was she concerned about the ability, for example, I am just
casting about for a reason to stimulate your recollection, the ability of Lee
to support a family of additional children, a larger family?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recall her commenting, and this most likely in the fall, that
Lee had said to her, have as many children as she wanted, but her own feeling
was that it is difficult to raise two, and especially as they didn't have a great
deal of money, that two would be a good size family. We also discussed the
differing attitudes between Americans and Russians on what is a large family.
Two is considered quite a large family, two or three in Russia, where both parents
normally work, and it is difficult to support a very large family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you keep the appointment with Planned Parenthood?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever attend with her a Planned Parenthood meeting or
session, visit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Her husband was killed before it was time to go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is, Lee Oswald was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. One had to wait until at least 6 weeks after the birth of the baby
before going, or 5 or 6 weeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I go on to December.</p>

<p>There are two notations, both written down in advance of this time, and both
notes indicating when to go to a clinic, and neither of these appointments was
kept.</p>

<p>There is a notation on the 3d of December, "Vine Clinic, Bay 12 noon." The
Vine Street Clinic was a well baby clinic in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What do you mean "well baby"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is a clinic where any mother can bring children for inoculations,
or preventive health measures. I think I have already mentioned a
previous notation about the Vine Clinic on November 5. I might have skipped
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think you did.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There is an entry on November 5, "Vine Clinic 12 o'clock."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that was to be a visit by Marina with her child?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. June.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. June. Did that include Rachel as well?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Rachel only went along, and we were told that she should come
in about four weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That Marina should?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, that is the baby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The baby June?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, should be 6 weeks old or so before they give the first&mdash;no,
that the baby Rachel should also come, but that she should be older before
giving her the first inoculation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Therefore, you made the entry as of December 5, to bring the
baby for the first time to that clinic?</p>

<p>Of course, that never took place.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I might point out that we were advised that we could change
the registration of June and make registration for Rachel in Irving at a well
baby clinic instead of in Dallas, but since the expectation was that Marina
would be back in Dallas after the 1st of the year, we decided to maintain that
clinic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is of interest to me, Mrs. Paine. There had been discussion
between you and Marina in which there appeared to be an expectation on her
part that she would have rejoined her husband by the 1st of the year?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I thought I had already made that clear, yes indeed, and this
just adds to that indication.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So that these are entries that physically are related to the current
expectation then existing of her return to her husband, joining him in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To live with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>There is a a notation on December 4, "Clinic 6 weeks".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me.</p>

<p>The first of those entries was made on November 5, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Just a minute.</p>

<p>No, October 29, "Dallas Junie" is the first Vine Street Clinic visit, followed
1 week later by a reading of her patch test, whatever the TB test was which
registered a false, positive but we went to the TB children's clinic to be certain
that it was a false positive, and she was cleared of any suspicion of TB on the
21st of November.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What I was getting at is that when you made the entry on
November 5, <span class="locked">1963&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And I would gather substantially contemporaneously with that
an entry on December 5, <span class="locked">1963&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. December 3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. December 3, 1963, that there was consciously in the minds
of both you and Marina as of November 5 that she would be rejoining her
husband by the first of the year.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct. I can give a little more detail on this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I wish you would, on that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We were visited at the home by a public health nurse in <span class="locked">Irving&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall. It doesn't appear, and I don't recall, though they
might have records of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am not trying to get the exact date. I am <span class="locked">really&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was after she had registered at Parkland, it was after the
baby was born.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was it in the month of October?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Probably.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And we were advised by this public health nurse that there was
a well baby clinic in Irving, which she conducted, and that she had been given
our name and address because of the care at Parkland, and she said that Marina
could come and bring her children to the clinic in Irving.</p>

<p>Then I mentioned that they had contact already with the Vine Street Clinic,
and I think after this visit from the nurse, Marina and I discussed where
it would be best for her to have <span class="locked">her&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Her clinic care?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Her association, her clinic, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And during the course of that conversation, go <span class="locked">on&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Marina expressed the opinion that it would be better to just
continue in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Because&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Because they would be again in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that squared with your impressions at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Indeed it did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Return to the record.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was another clinic visit that doesn't appear here. I
don't know why. Obviously, a lot of things happened that I didn't write down
but there was also a visit to, I will call it, a sick baby clinic where you go if
a child is ailing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And who was ailing? Or possibly so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My recollection was that no one was ailing, but we learned of it
and wanted to make registration. It was in the adjacent building to the TB
clinic.</p>

<p>Oh, no; I recall now why we went.</p>

<p>At the first Vine Street Clinic meeting, which is, I judge, the 29th of October,
the physician recommended that June go to the Freeman Memorial Clinic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. F-r-e-e-m-a-n?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To the best of my recollection. I am not certain. June has&mdash;I
don't know what it is called, but it is like a birthmark except that it is not
at the time of birth but a little blood vessel that collects and makes a red spot.
This was on her tummy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was on Marina's?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was on June's tummy and the doctor at the well baby clinic
suggested that she should have this looked at, and in this connection he referred
us to this other children's clinic, and we went for an examination there
at some time, and it doesn't appear on my calendar, and the doctors there
concluded that it was not necessary for that to be taken off. At the same time,
we filled out forms, more forms about Marina, so that she could be eligible, and
she did then get a card so that she could come to this clinic at any time that
her children were sick. And they no doubt would have a record of when
that was done.</p>

<p>My own best recollection would be that it was the morning of the 18th of
November, although there is no reference to it here. Then the final notation is
December 4. I started to mention this, but I don't believe I finished, "Clinic 6
weeks check 1." One refers to the post partum check at Parkland Memorial
Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was a part of the postnatal care?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. For Marina, and, of course, to check the baby's health, too, and
I simply sent notation about this appointment to Secret Service. That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Marina or June or Rachel or Lee, to your knowledge, have
any medical care by private physician, during the time of your acquaintance
with them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not to my knowledge, and I would be surprised.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Surprised? Why?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. If they had. They had very little money, and this arrangement
for the well baby clinic had been made by Marina well before I knew her.
June had already been once or twice in Dallas to the Vine Street Clinic. I
judged that Marina, a trained pharmacist, was concerned about health, and
wanted to get proper medical care whether or not they could pay for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, now have we covered all of your calendar, which
sometimes served as a diary, being Commission Exhibit No. 401?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. We will adjourn until 2:15.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 1:20 p.m., the proceeding was recessed.)</p>

<hr />
<h2>TESTIMONY OF RUTH HYDE PAINE RESUMED</h2>

<p>The proceedings reconvened at 2:45 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We will resume. Directing your attention to Commission Exhibit
No. 402, which is your address book, would you do with that what you
did with your calendar diary, and go through it page by page, and tell us of
any entries on particular pages which relate to the Oswalds?</p>

<p>The first sheet of the exhibit is the cover. Next is the inside cover, and the
reverse of the first page. Is there anything on any of the entries which appear
on those pages which relate to the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The one on the left is the police officer who picked up the address
book.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Those are his initials and date that he picked it up?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know who picked it up. And I didn't see it was gone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, yes; as you testified. The next page is the "A" page, the
left and right hand.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. These have no significance to the Oswalds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next is the B page, left and right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No significance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Bell Helicopter is the place at which your husband is employed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next page is the C page, left-hand.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You are still on B.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You are still on B.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The left-hand here on this exhibit is the reverse side of the B
page, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Anything on there relating to the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You have on this page two neighbors of mine, Ann Bell met
both Marina and Lee, and she has been interviewed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Other than that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Other than that, no significance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next is the right-hand of the B page, and the first page
of the C page. Any of those names or addresses related to the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Next is the opposite face of the C page and the first page of the
D page.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Nothing there related to the Oswalds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next is the reverse side of the C page and the first page
of the D page.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Also nothing related.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next is the reverse side of the D page and the first page
of the E page.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Nothing there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Next, the reverse side of the D page and the first face of the
E page.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Nothing of significance with relation to the Oswalds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Next is the reverse of the E page and the first face of the
F page.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recall being refreshed by this entry, Four Continents Book
Store. I went into this book store during the summer, my summer trip, and
inquired of the lady at the cashier's desk something that I wanted to find,
and realized that she did not speak any English, she did not understand me.
And I heard other people&mdash;there is a book store where you can obtain materials
in Russian&mdash;it imports from Russia, and had materials that I wanted
to get to help me with teaching Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is this located in Irving, Tex.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This is in New York City. <span class="locked">And&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have not frequented that place before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have been in there before, yes; in a different year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you aware, then, of the factor you have now recounted?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; the only reason I bring it up is that I related this incident
to Marina as an illustration of the fact that one needn't know English fluently
to get a job&mdash;if there were a Russian-speaking community, where Russian
could be used. That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then the reverse of the page and the first face of the G page.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Nothing of significance here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Next, the reverse of the F page and the first face of the G page.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, there is a reference to D. Gravitis, and also the name of
her son-in-law appears here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And her son-in-law is?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Ilya Mamantov.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And at the bottom of the page?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; there is an entry for Everett Glover, whose name has
appeared in the testimony, and whose connection is known.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Nothing else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Nothing else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The reverse of the G page and the face of the H page.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Nothing significant there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Globe Parcel Service. Didn't you make some reference to that
in your testimony?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; not in any connection to the Oswalds. But this was an
address given to me by my Russian tutor. This is a service which will help
you to send parcels to people behind the Iron Curtain. They see to it that
it is either delivered or returned&mdash;whereas, sometimes without that service it
will be neither delivered or returned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you seek to resort to its services in connection with any
of your association with the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. I, in fact, have not used the service. I only have their
address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Next is the reverse of the G page and the facing page of the H page.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Mild significance in that the name of my one Russian student
appears here, Bill Hootkins.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And his telephone <span class="locked">number&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Is there; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The reverse of the H page and the face of the I page. Now,
let's take the reverse of the H page first, first side. The two pages&mdash;the
left-hand one has Samuel and Liz Hagner, and the opposite page at the top has
Carol Hyde. On those two pages, are there any entries dealing with the
Oswalds or relating to them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. None; except that it contains an address of several of my relatives,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
and these are people to whom I spoke about the Oswalds, and that has
appeared in the testimony. Other than that, no significance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Next would be&mdash;there are some empty pages. We better record
that fact. The reverse <span class="locked">side&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They are not in your exhibit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As we have gone along, there are some blank pages in your
address book.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. But they are not in the exhibit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Those blank pages, except as they are in proximity to pages that
have some entries on them, were not photostated.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And do not appear as part of Commission Exhibit 402?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, I am now directing your attention in the picture
exhibit to the page on which the letter J appears at the top.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. There is nothing of significance here in relation to the
Oswalds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And next is a page in which a letter K appears at the top of
the list of letters.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Nothing of significance here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next is a page in which the top letter is L.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Nothing here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the next, on the right-hand side is a page, the top letter
of which is M. On the opposite page in the photograph there are entries
also. Look at both pages, please.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There is one significant entry for Dutz and Lillian Murret.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 757 French Street, New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Telephone number HU 8-4326.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Those are the aunt and uncle of the late Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. And this was filled in after my second visit to New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long after? You mean while you were there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Probably while I was there. But I know I didn't have their
address or their name correct during the summer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was during your visit&mdash;your second visit to New Orleans that
you learned fully of their name and address and telephone number, and you
made an entry in your address book?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There is one above that, is there not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And I believe this person has been referred to in testimony&mdash;Helen
Mamikonian. She was my roommate at Middlebury College, summer
Russian school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, the next is a sheet that is opposite the sheet,
the top letter of which is M.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This just gives a current address for the same person&mdash;Helen
Mamikonian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you. And the next is a sheet, the top letter of which is N.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Nothing significant here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next is a sheet, the top letter of which is O. You have
testified fully as to all the entries on that sheet, have you not, heretofore?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next is a sheet in which the top letter appearing is the
letter P.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are there any entries on that sheet that relate to the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The entry for Plattner Clinic, in Grand Prairie, was made because
I inquired of them about the cost of maternity care at their clinic and hospital,
for Marina.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No other entry of significance on that page?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next is the page opposite that&mdash;the top letter of which is Q.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No significance here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next is the page the top letter of which is R.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Significant here is an entry for Ed and Dorothy Roberts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Those are your next door neighbors?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Those are my next door neighbors, and also Randle, which refers
to Mrs. William Randle. And the one below has been covered in testimony&mdash;that
is Frolick and Pen Rainey.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Frolick, I should say to you, Mrs. Paine, is spelled F-r-o-e-l-i-c-h,
although you do not have it so entered. The next page is the page opposite
the page, the top letter of which is S.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Nothing of significance here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next is a page the top letter of which, for some strange
reason is also S. It is the <span class="locked">opposite&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The last one you had was facing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this is the reverse side of the S page. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No significance in relation to the Oswalds. It does list the name
of the school at which I taught Russian, Saint Mark's School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By the way, would you identify the Strattons?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; they are very good friends of mine who I have known
from work with the Young Friends Committee of North America. He was
chairman of the East-West Contacts Committee while I was chairman of the
subcommittee on pen pal correspondence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Nothing else on the S page?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next is a page on which the top letter appears to be T.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No significance here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next is a page, the right-hand one of which has the top
letter U, and then there are entries not on that page but on the page to the
left of that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No significance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next is a page on which the top letter appears also as U.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; no significance here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But the first name on which refers to Dick Uviller.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next is a page the top letter of which appears to be V.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No significance here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next is a page the top letter of which appears to be W.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No significance here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The next is a page the top letter of which is Y.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No significance in relation to the Oswalds, except as testified.
I did talk to Mrs. Young.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. Those are entries dealing with your in-laws, the Youngs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And there are three entries.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. The first one has no relation whatsoever to my relatives.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is a different Young entirely?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But the next two, Arthur M. Young, and Charles Morris&mdash;those
are your in-laws?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And Arthur Young's father, Charles Morris Young.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Charles Morris Young is Arthur M. Young's father?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Father.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Arthur M. Young is the stepfather of your husband, Michael
Ralph Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Charles Morris Young is the stepgrandfather of your husband,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; that is correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Mrs. Paine, would you please give us your reactions
to and your concept of Marina Oswald as a person, your reflections on her personality
generally, and her character and integrity, her philosophy? What kind
of a person was she?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I enjoyed knowing her. She was a great deal of company to me
in my home. She liked to help me with the language problems I had. She was
very good at explaining a word I didn't understand in other Russian words
that would then make clear to me the meaning of the word I didn't understand.</p>

<p>She is, as I have already testified, a hard worker. She liked to help around
the house. She had some doubts about her ability in cooking, unfounded
doubts, I felt. She wanted to learn from me about cooking. I did most of the
meal preparation. But she would occasionally prepare meals, and she taught
me some things. I think she is a mixture, as are many people, of confidence
and lack of confidence.</p>

<p>She knows, I am certain, that she is an intelligent and able person. But, on
the other hand, as I have testified, she was hesitant to learn to pronounce&mdash;to
practice pronouncing English words and didn't consider that she had much
ability in English. She did say to me in the fall&mdash;I think it was after Mr.
Hosty's visit that she observed of herself that unlike the time when she had
first come to this country and did not even attempt to listen to English conversation,
she had picked up enough so that it was worth her while to try to
listen, and then she could pick up some words and some meaning. I may have
already testified to this.</p>

<p>I think she is a person who prized her personal privacy. She did&mdash;I should
say we confided to one another about our respective marriages, as I have already
testified. There was some intimacy of confidence, of this kind of confidence,
I should say. But I felt that she prized and guarded her own personal
privacy.</p>

<p>She was in some ways&mdash;she talked with some enthusiasm and detail to me
about her time in Minsk, when she was dating and the good times that she had
had there, living at that time with her aunt and uncle in Minsk&mdash;how she
enjoyed herself, and something of the social life she enjoyed.</p>

<p>She spoke of spending time with hairdos and clothes, what to wear, and
when she looked back on it, girlish pastimes that she had no time for now as
a young mother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she ever say anything to you&mdash;you brought something out
about Russia&mdash;about any hopes or desires or thoughts about America while she
was in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She did say once that she had dreamed of coming to America.
I think she meant dreamed while sleeping.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I beg your pardon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think she meant dreamed while sleeping.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she indicate anything beyond that&mdash;that is, that she had a
dream&mdash;did she indicate any hope or desire or affinity, willingness to come to
America?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; that this was also a hope on her part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she indicate this was a hope prior to the time she had
married Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It wasn't clear to me when this hope arose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she indicate it was a hope or desire on her part wholly
divorced from Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you were telling me about your impressions of Marina's
personality, her character, her integrity.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We spoke once, to my recollection, about our respective beliefs
in God. She told me that she observed, looking at the nations of the world,
and their religious books, like the Bible, the Koran, that people all over the world
for centuries believed in God, had this faith, and she felt that such an idea
could not arise so many places as it were spontaneously and live on so many
places unless there were something to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she say anything about the philosophy in Russia toward
religion as negative or positive?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This was implied. I can't give you a specific reference, except
that she did say her grandmother was a very religious person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By the way, did she have her children baptized in this country?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. One of the first things I knew&mdash;and this was told to me in
March of 1963&mdash;one of the first times I went to see her at their apartment, on
Neely Street, she showed me a baptismal certificate for June, and was pleased
with how nice it looked, its attractive form. I have since read in the paper
that she had this baptismal ceremony without Lee's knowledge and consent.
She made no reference to me at that time of that sort, and nothing to indicate
that I shouldn't tell anyone I pleased, Lee included, that there was such a
baptismal certificate, or refer to it freely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In her discussions of her life in Russia, did there arise occasions
when she discussed communism or the Communist Party or people who were
interested in communism or the Communist Party in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She referred rather disparagingly to some of the young Communist
youth group people. She felt they were rather dull and attended meetings
and heard the same thing over and over, said much the same thing. She
also spoke disparagingly of the content of this paper which I said she told me
was from Minsk, and always containing many columns of speech by Khrushchev,
speech by Khrushchev, speech by comrade chairman of the presidium, whatever
Khrushchev was. And she found this very dull. Very repetitious. She, herself,
expressed interest in the movies and theater activities in the town. She always
turned to this <span class="locked">portion&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Legitimate theater?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. She turned to this <span class="locked">portion&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you say town, you mean Minsk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. She turned to this portion of the newspaper and really
expressed herself as only interested in that. In this connection, I can say she
told me the plots of movies that she had seen some years before, and retold
them in some detail, with considerable interest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she say anything about having seen movies in Russia
originating in America, in the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Possibly. I don't recall specifically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she indicate how she had acquired her interest in the
United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; she didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was leading her to be favorably disposed to come and live
in this country?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; she did not.</p>

<p>She spoke of having met some young Cuban students who were traveling
in Russia, or studying in Minsk, or both&mdash;I am not certain. But she commented
on how Latin their personality was, how warm and open, and how they would
strum guitars in the street and go about in noisy crowds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she ever say anything to you or intimate at any time prior
to November 22&mdash;let's say prior to November 23&mdash;of any desire, attempt or
otherwise on the part of Lee Oswald to reach Cuba?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; she did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was&mdash;were the references to Cuba limited to those with regard
to Castro on the FPCC incident in New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Lee is the only one who mentioned the FPCC incident, and then
without the initials or name of that organization. And then, of course, this
reference in Minsk was to students who had been there only.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have given me a number of specifics. But I don't think you
have yet told me your opinion of Marina Oswald the person, insofar as her character,
integrity, general philosophy&mdash;as a person and a woman.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I like her and care a lot about her. I feel that&mdash;as I have testified,
any full communication between us was limited by my modest command
of the language, and that we were also and are different sorts of people. I
feel that I cannot predict how she might feel in a particular situation, whereas
some of my friends I feel I can guess that they would feel as I would in a situation.
I don't have that feeling about Marina. She is more of an enigma to
me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you say she is an appreciative person?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I would. I could not convince her of how helpful it was to
me to have her at my home in the fall of 1963. She was&mdash;thanked me too much,
I felt. It was very helpful to me, to have her there, both because I was lonely,
and because I was interested in the language. And I also reassured her many
times that it was not costing me unduly financially&mdash;that this was not a burden.
But I never felt I fully convinced her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, is there anything you would like to say off record or add
to this record with respect to Marina Oswald as a person?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think I have said the bulk of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will ask you this&mdash;your view or opinion as to whether Marina
Oswald was or could have been an agent of the government of the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republic.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My opinion is that she could not have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was not and could not have been?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Was not and could not have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I wish to include both&mdash;that she was not and could not have
been?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My impression was distinctly that she was not. I don't exclude
the possibility that she could have been. I don't feel I have knowledge.
It would seem to me highly unlikely. But that is different from being certain.
I might add this. I think&mdash;things she said to me on the evening of the 22d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. 22d of November 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. After we had returned from the police station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had returned to your home after being at the police station?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We returned to the home, had dinner, had talked for a little
while in the living room, seen and sent home two Life reporters, and then were
preparing for bed. And she and I talked a little bit, standing in the kitchen.
She said both of the following things in a spirit of confusion and with a stunned
quality, I would say, to her voice and her manner. She said to me all the
information she had or most of it that she had about the Kennedy family came
to her through translation from Lee, and that she <span class="locked">thought&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What do you mean translation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, in other words, if Lee read in the paper something about
the Kennedys, or if there was something in Time Magazine about them, he
would translate to Marina, that is, put into Russian what was said in this news
media, and, therefore, inform her. And she thought that if he had had negative
feelings about Kennedy, that this would have come along with the translation
from Lee. But there was no such indication of dislike from Lee to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, this impressed you why?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I just record that she said it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It has impressed you to the point at which you wish to relate
it here. Why is that? You were relating it to what&mdash;to her groping as to why
her husband committed this act?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Her wondering whether he could have, but not in a defensive
way, but in this stunned way that I am trying to describe. And in the same
way she told me <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is, is it your concept that she was ruminating&mdash;how could
he have said these things or called her attention to these things with respect to
President Kennedy, and still have assassinated him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it in the sense that she was hurt, she could not understand
it&mdash;or was she trying to rationalize that her husband, because of this, could not
have assassinated the President?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was more in the sense being hurt and confused. Not concluding
that he had assassinated the President. But not attempting to conclude
from this small piece of information that he had not. She also said that just
the night before, the evening of the 21st, Lee had said to her he wanted to get
an apartment soon, just as soon as she could, together again. And this was
said very much with a feeling of hurt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Hurt what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I have to interpret, because we didn't talk about it. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
my interpretation was that here he was making this gesture of caring for her,
and wanting to bring the family together, and live with her again on a full-time
basis. But then on the other hand, how could he be suggesting this if he
had been planning to do something which would inevitably lead to the break-up
of the family. This, again, in the spirit of the other comment from her just
related, of confusion and hurt, rather than defense.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is, rather than defense of him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Of him; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Nothing else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have a recollection of having written your sister in June
of 1957&mdash;as a matter of fact, on June 29, 1957&mdash;[See Ruth Paine Exhibit 469, and
transcript 390, post.] in which, to orient the letter, you stated, "Last Saturday I
started Russian class," and that was your class at the University of Pennsylvania
in the summer of 1957&mdash;in which you recounted the reasons why you were undertaking
the study of Russian. Do you recall such a letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall the letter, but it certainly is likely I wrote it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In which you said, one, that you enjoyed the study of languages.
Is it a fact that that was one of the motivations?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, two, that the language would be socially useful to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Socially?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would be socially useful to you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't understand what that meant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I can't explain it. I assume it meant that you were recounting
that you might use it in your social intercourse with others who also
spoke Russian, in seeking&mdash;for example, concerning your pen pal activity and
that sort of thing. This does not awaken anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It doesn't awaken any recollection; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Three, that it advanced your "interest in Russian
exchange."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I may have hoped so, starting Russian. But my actual
skill didn't progress fast enough to be of any real use.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, also, that ever since, "The Young Friends Conference in
1955," you had felt a leaning to the study of language.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct. And I have so testified&mdash;I used the word "calling"
in the testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And do you recall emphasizing in that letter that the study of
Russian on your part was an intellectual decision, using those very words&mdash;intellectual
decision?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall using those words. It is reasonable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As you recall back now, was that&mdash;did that activate you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am not entirely certain what I meant by intellectual decision.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I assume you meant a deliberate one.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. One of intellectual curiosity?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would judge so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall writing your mother, as far back as October 1956,
that&mdash;no; this letter was to your whole family&mdash;that is, those back in Columbus,
addressed to your mother, your father, and&mdash;what was&mdash;Essie?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I think probably family in this case just was my mother
and father at that time. Essie is my brother's wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In which you then said you were thinking about studying Russian
as an intellectual pursuit? Does that sound like something you might
have said then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It sounds like I thought myself more intellectual at the time
than I do now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But as you harken back on it, the elements I have now recounted
to you from correspondence with your mother and your folks, are those factors
which at least impelled you at that age and that development in your life to
undertake the study of Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And these are all in addition to those reasons that you gave
us yesterday, of course.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I would like to know if you had any conversations with Marina
on any of the following subjects. I have a long list, most of which you have
already covered, and I will skip those. Have you now recounted to us all of
the conversations you had with Marina respecting interviews by the FBI?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To the best of my recollection; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any conversations&mdash;have you told us all on the subject of Lee
Oswald's Texas School Book Depository job, his reactions to it, the nature of
the work, his fellow employees?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he ever speak of his fellow employees at the Depository?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; except Wesley, who drove him to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have told us all he has ever recounted to you on the subject
of his military service?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. His political views?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I believe I have told you all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any particular books in which he was interested?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know of any books.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. None that I saw him read.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have told us all you can recall about Oswald's treatment
of Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And any conversations you had with him on the subject?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he ever discuss or did she ever discuss the matter of his
dishonorable discharge from the Marines?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was never mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By either she or him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right. Not by either one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were aware of some of that, were you? You were aware
of the fact that he was first honorably discharged and then when he reached
Russia and attempted to <span class="locked">defect&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Only through reading the paper after the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. All I am seeking is, you were aware of the incident at
the time that you met the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I was aware that he had gone to Russia, but not that he
had received an unsatisfactory discharge, whatever the word is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you first learn of that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. From the newspaper after the assassination. Undesirable, the
word is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Undesirable discharge. Did he ever speak of Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Never, to my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he ever speak or&mdash;well, did he ever speak in your presence
of his dreams or aspirations?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Either for himself individually or for his family?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you told us everything about her dreams and aspirations
for herself and her family that you can now recall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't believe I have said that she related to me that she would
like some day to have her own home and her own furniture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think you told us that this morning.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It appears in the Look article, but I don't think I mentioned it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, yes; speaking of articles, at any time during the meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
you had with her on March 9, was anything said about magazine articles&mdash;let
us say&mdash;did you discuss the Life article with her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We discussed the recent Time cover issue, on which Marina
appeared.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, I see. What was said on that score?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She thought it was misleading.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That the article itself was misleading?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Further, she thought it was unkind to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Unkind in the sense that it was inaccurately unkind or that
some things were recounted she thought ought not to have been recounted?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Inaccurately unkind. And she said something to the effect of
judging that the American people or at least portions of the press would have
to look that way upon the wife of an accused assassin. With which I disagreed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, what did you say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I said I thought that was Time Magazine in particular, and had
nothing to do with the views of the populace in general, I said I thought that
was better reflected by the letters that she had gotten from a great many
thoughtful and concerned people who had written to her of their sympathy
and support.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she respond to that comment on your part?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall any particular thing she said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she evidence any feeling or reaction in your meeting on
March 9 to the generosity of Americans who had made these contributions
voluntarily?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; she did, particularly in response to a comment I made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We had been talking about the lawyer and business manager
whom she is trying to fire.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is Mr. Thorne and Mr. Martin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; and I said she has seen the range of kind of people in
America&mdash;one side the many generous people who sent her thoughtful notes
and small checks to help her in her financial difficulty, and on the other side
the wolves who wanted to gain money from this situation for themselves. And
she concurred in that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was aware of that distinction?</p>

<p>Did she indicate an awareness of that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She thought that was an apt description; yes. I felt that she
thought that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, have you told us everything you can recall about Lee
Oswald's ability to drive an automobile and operate an automobile, and your
efforts to improve that driving capacity, and his efforts to obtain a driver's
license? Is there anything at all now that you can recall that you have not
told us?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There isn't anything at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any conversation any time with respect to Lee Oswald
himself returning to Russia, as distinguished from Marina being returned
to Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was no conversation of any sort nor any implication of
that to me at any time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there any discussion at any time on the subject of his
desiring to obtain or having obtained a passport to Russia in the summer
of 1963 or any other time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was no discussion of this at any time in my presence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And were you aware at any time prior to November 23, 1963,
that he had obtained or had applied for a passport?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; and I wasn't aware until later, in fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you told us everything now on the subject of Lee Oswald's
efforts with respect to Marina returning to Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you told us everything that you can recall respecting
President Kennedy and Mrs. Kennedy and any comments or observations on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
the part of either Lee Oswald or Marina Oswald with respect to the Kennedys?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have related all my recollections.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you related all your recollections respecting the attitude
of either of them toward the Government of the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there anything you now recall in addition to what you have
testified to with respect to the connection of either of them with or contacts,
rather than connection&mdash;of either of them with the Communist Party in the
United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was not aware of any contact by either of them with the
Communist Party in the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the same question with respect to the Socialist Workers
Party.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Nor was I aware of any such contact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you now give us your impression of Lee Oswald's personality?
Was he a person who sought friends, was he a man who sought his
own comfort, his own consolation?</p>

<p>I am just trying to illustrate what I am getting at. Was he a man who,
to use the vernacular, was a loner? Do you know what I mean by that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have heard the word used a great deal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. A man who preferred his own company, or at least appears to
prefer his own company, and does not seek out others, does not seek to make
friends, or even has an aversion to the making of friends, that he is reticent,
retiring.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think it was here this morning that I described him as a person
whom I thought was fearful of actually making friends, and, therefore, reticent,
who did keep to himself in fact a good deal.</p>

<p>But I think he did enjoy talking with other people&mdash;at least some of the
time. He did watch television a great deal of the total time that he was at my
house.</p>

<p>And he would finish the evening meal earlier than the rest of the people at
the table and leave to go back to the living room to read or watch television,
and not just stay to converse. He would eat to be fed rather than as a social
event.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. Just to make sure we have the record clear on this&mdash;because
it is of interest in other sections of this investigation&mdash;except for the
one or two instances you have related, his habit was to remain in your home
the entire weekend whenever he visited?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were there any occasions in which he related or recounted, or
she, of his having made any friendships in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He never mentioned anyone he knew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say anything about what he did after hours, after work
hours in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Only the reference I have already related, of having been to the
National Indignation Committee meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was the only occasion? What was your impression of
what he did, from all you heard and saw in your home when he was there, or
any conversations you had with Marina, as to how he occupied his time after
work hours, during the week when he remained in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My impression, insofar as I have one, is that he spent evenings
at his room, and he had mentioned, as I have said, that the room he had moved
to had television privileges, and I, therefore, guessed that he made use of that
opportunity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have the impression, or what impression did you have
on this score&mdash;as to whether he was a man who had&mdash;who somewhat lacked
confidence in himself, or might have been resentful that he was not generally
accepted as a man of capacity?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think he had a combination of a lack of confidence in himself
and a mistaken, as I have said, overblown impression of himself, these operating
at the same time.</p>

<p>I think he felt that he wanted more skilled work than he was doing at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
School Book Depository. But the major impression I carry about his feeling of
work at the School Book Depository was that it was income, and he was glad
to have it.</p>

<p>I recall Marina's saying that Lee Oswald looked upon his brother Robert as a
fool in that he was primarily interested in his home and family and that his
interests in the world didn't really step beyond that. Marina commented then
herself on this, and said she thought those were very legitimate interests.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In his presence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; not in his presence. She was telling me what Lee had said
when he was not there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is your impression of Robert Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, as I have testified, I have very little impression of him,
having only met him twice. I might add to that that he seems a nice guy, as
far as I can see&mdash;fairly regular, plain person. But that is my guess. I cannot
say I have a clear impression of my own.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall an occasion when Marina had a conversation with
Mrs. Gravitis?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. By telephone. Oh, no; we went over one time, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And there was a conversation that went back and forth about
their life in the United States up to that point?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; some of that conversation went back and forth faster than
I could follow it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, do you recall an incident in the course of that conversation
in which Mrs. Gravitis made a remark that anyone could get work in that
locality, and that there was plenty of construction work going on, to which
Marina responded that construction work was beneath the dignity of her
husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I recall a conversation of this nature, or you have just
recalled it to me, that Mrs. Gravitis thought that jobs were available if you
were willing to do the work. I don't recall just what Marina's reply was. I
do recall her saying that he found his work at the Minsk factory more physically
heavy than he was easily able to handle, and the reference to&mdash;I don't recall
her objection to the mention of construction, but if there was one I would guess
it was more this nature, than indicating being above such things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That he might find heavy construction work or construction work
generally physically difficult?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; this from my recollection of what she said about the Minsk
job, not from my recollection of this conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall during the course of that conversation some comments
in which Marina implied that when they were in Fort Worth, at least,
that, arising out of her experience there, that both of them rather did not want
further contact with the people in Fort Worth because her husband Lee did not
agree with them personality wise?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall anything of that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you ever recall her saying during the course of that conversation
that her husband was an idealist?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall that, either. I have been trying to recall whether
the name of Peter Gregory came up in any conversation with Marina. I have
earlier testified today that it was my impression that I had not heard his name
until the 22d of November. I have a vague impression that he was mentioned,
or that this name was known to me. But it is very hard for me to get a hold of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To recall, you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To recall; yes. At some point, and it might have been that
afternoon of the 22d, or it might have been earlier, there was a conversation
which has left me with the clear impression that Marina admired and thought
highly of Peter Gregory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Peter is the father or the son?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Peter is the father. But, as I say, my recollection is vague on
this, and I don't know when that conversation might have taken place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever say to your sister that you were of the opinion that
Lee Oswald was a Communist?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does the group known as the Women's International League for
Peace and Democracy&mdash;is that a group with which you are familiar?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have heard the name. I can't recall whether I have ever joined
or not. I wouldn't think so. But I just don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your best recollection at the moment is that you cannot recall
having had any contact with that group?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Except possibly some literature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Between the 1st and the 5th of November 1963, did you make any
effort to obtain the address of Lee Oswald in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How tall are you, Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Around 5 feet 10 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will ask you this general question. I take it, Mrs. Paine, that
your study of and interest in the Russian language did not emanate in any
degree from any interest on your part in associating yourself with any activities
which were in turn to be associated with Russia and the Communist Party or
Communist interests.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It certainly did not stem from any such interest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your continued pursuit of it does not stem from any such
motivation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; it does not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think I have asked you this, but I want to make sure it is in
the record. You are a pacificist?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I consider myself such. I don't like to consider myself as rigidly
adhering to any particular doctrine. I believe in appraising a situation and
determining my own action in terms of that particular situation, and not making
a rigid or blanket philosophy dictate my behavior.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you are opposed to violence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whether it be violence for the overthrow of a government, or a
chink in the government, or physical violence of any kind or character?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I consider it to be&mdash;violence to be&mdash;always harmful to the
values I believe in, and just reserve the right to, as I have said, appraise each
situation in the light of that initial belief.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, you have read a number of newspaper articles and
also various magazine articles dealing with the tragedy of November 22, 1963,
and the Oswalds, and even of yourself. Do you have an overall reaction of any
kind to those articles and newspaper stories, particularly with respect to their
accuracy, you knowing what you do as to what the actual facts were and are?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There are several things I might say in reply to that.</p>

<p>First, I have thought about someday teaching a course in high school on the
subject of newspaper and magazine accuracy, using this particular story of the
assassination of President Kennedy as source material.</p>

<p>I have been impressed with both the inaccuracy of things I have read and
my inability to judge inaccuracy when they do not&mdash;when the story does not
refer to things I personally know about.</p>

<p>On the whole, my feeling has been that the press has been pretty accurate in
reporting what I have said. I have by no means seen all of what was reported
of what I said.</p>

<p>I might say in this connection, but in a slightly different department, that
you will see a large stack of newspapers on a table in my house when you come.
They represent the newspapers I have not <span class="locked">yet&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Perused?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. More than that&mdash;not yet found courage enough to read. They
are the newspapers of late November and of December. And while I have tried
to read them, I usually end crying, and so I have not gotten very far.</p>

<p>I might say, just to be perfectly clear, that my problem is my grief over the
death of the President. That is what brings me to tears&mdash;much more than my own
personal touch with the story&mdash;although this just makes more poignant my grief.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will read some listings that appeared in Lee Oswald's memorandum
or diary or address book, and ask you whether they were mentioned during
the period of your acquaintance with the Oswalds, or whether you might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
have heard about them otherwise. The Russ.-Amer. Citizenship Club, 2730
Snyder Avenue.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have never heard of the organization, and I am not certain
where such a street might be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I am not, either. I am just reading all of the entry there
is in the diary.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And I am to simply say whether it rings any bell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is right. Russ. Language School, 1212 Spruce.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I know the Spruce Street is in Philadelphia, but, otherwise, that
rings no bell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Russian Lan., and then Trn.&mdash;216 South 20th.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I assume that means Russian <span class="locked">language&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Training?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Trn.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Probably. It is not familiar to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Next, Russ. Groth. Hos. Organ.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Could it be hospitality?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It might be. I will read it in full. Russ. Groth. Hosp. Organ,
1733 Spring.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This organization is not familiar to me.</p>

<p>May I say each street appears in Philadelphia. In other words, Snyder, I
recall as being in Philadelphia, and Spring is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is Spruce.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Spruce was the first one I recall. The last you mentioned was
Spring; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. None of those entries awakens anything in your mind in
any respect?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During these weekends in the fall period, when Marina was living
with you, I take it your husband visited at your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he visit on other than weekends?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Occasionally. It seems to me he often came on Tuesday evening.
And then he came on Friday, and sometimes on Sunday afternoon, as I have
testified.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He would visit Friday evening and then return to his quarters.
And he would visit reasonably often on Sunday and return to his quarters?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Every now and then on Sunday, I would say. And then sometimes
during the week on a Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, if you had become aware prior to November 22 of
the fact, if it be a fact, that there was a rifle in the blanket wrapped package on
the floor of your garage, what do you think now you would have done?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can say certainly I would not have wanted it there.</p>

<p>And that my pacifist feelings would have entered into my consideration of the
subject. I cannot say certainly what I would have done, of course. And, as I
have described myself and my beliefs, I like to consider the situation that I am
in and react according to that situation, rather than to have doctrine or rigid
belief.</p>

<p>I can certainly say this. I would have asked that it be entirely out of reach
of children or out of sight of children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, when the FBI agent interviewed you on November 1, had you
known of the existence of the rifle on the floor of the garage, what is your
present thought as to what you might have done with respect to advising the
FBI of its existence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would seriously doubt that I would have considered it of significance
to the FBI. I know that a great many people in Texas go deer hunting.
As one of the FBI agents said to me after the assassination, he surmised
that every other house in the street had a rifle, a deer rifle.</p>

<p>I would have simply considered this was offensive to me, but of no consequence
or interest to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You see what I am getting at. Would the existence of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
knowledge of the rifle on the floor of your garage, connected with Lee Oswald's
history as you knew it up to that point, and some of the suspicions that you
voiced in your testimony with respect to Lee Oswald, have led you to be apprehensive
out of the ordinary as to the existence of that rifle on the floor of
your garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't believe I would have assumed that this rifle was for any
other purpose than deer hunting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did the FBI, any of the FBI agents inquire of you prior to November
22, 1963, as to whether there were any firearms in and about your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did any FBI agent inquire of you as to whether you thought there
was any suspicious&mdash;anything suspicious about Lee Harvey Oswald that caused
you any concern with respect to the safety of the Government of the United
States or any individual in it, in that Government?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; they made no such inquiry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And I would repeat this line of questioning with respect to Marina
as well as Lee. Would your answers be the same if I did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; they would be the same.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, Marina testified of her impression that when Lee returned
to Dallas, and then to your home on the 4th of October 1963, that he&mdash;when
he came to your home he had a valise or a suitcase.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Marina testified, did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. What impression do you have in that respect?</p>

<p>I realize that when you reached your home he was out on the front lawn.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. On what day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Fourth of October 1963.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. He arrived at my home before I did on the 4th of October.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; I said that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. But it was on the 21st of November that he was out on the front
lawn when I arrived. My recollection is <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Please. I am referring back to the time that he came from
Dallas initially. That was the 4th of October.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have any recollection as to any luggage of any kind or
character that he might or did bring with him on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. None.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. None whatsoever. Did you ever see him take any luggage out
of your home anytime after he had come to your home on October 4?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. And, as I believe I have testified, it is my impression that
I took him to the bus station in Irving on the 7th of October, and then he carried
both shirts over his arm freshly ironed, and this green zipper bag. But this is
my impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In any event, at no time from October&mdash;including October 4 to
November 22 did you see him have in his possession any luggage other than the
green zipper bag?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That he was carrying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. My statement is correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have no recollection of any other kind of luggage being used by
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did the subject of abortion&mdash;was the subject of abortion ever one
discussed between you and Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. And I think I have so testified. When&mdash;part of our first
meeting, as we talked in the park, or close to the first meeting, after having left
her apartment in March, and walked to the park&mdash;she told me that she was
going to have a baby, and she said that she didn't believe in abortion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that when the discussion occurred on birth control?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was that discussion on birth control directed towards her
avoiding a larger family?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Future pregnancies; yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was devoted solely to that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Representative Ford has left with me some questions. I think
probably I might have covered them all.</p>

<p>Would you give us, please, your views with respect to what you understand
to be the Russian system or philosophy&mdash;that is, I am not seeking your views as
to what it is, but as to either your sympathy or empathy or aversion to it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am of the opinion that&mdash;saying the Russian system is rather a
larger statement than saying the Communist system. But it may be that the
question was intended to speak about the Communists, or governmental system.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think that probably is the thrust of Representative Ford's
inquiry.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, as I have already testified, I dislike deception in any form.
I might go on to say that I think the people of Russia on the whole have very
little choice about their leaders at elections <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is the antithesis of democracy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is certainly a dictatorship.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that is abhorent to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it, then, far from having any sympathy with or admiration
for communism or what we might call the Russian system or philosophy, you
have an aversion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have an aversion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you ever studied Karl Marx?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; not in the sense of studied. I think one history course in
college included a few readings from Karl Marx.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your readings of Karl Marx's writings have been confined to your
work at Antioch College as a student?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. And they were very brief.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever read the Manifesto?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The Communist Manifesto?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was part of the same course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But there, again, your studying of it or reading of it was limited
to the college course?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you did not pursue it thereafter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And if I asked you the same question with respect to Das Capital,
would your answers be the same?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have seen the size of the book, and I certainly would not want
to read it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In any event, you have not read it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have not read it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Even in connection with a college course?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Even in connection with a college course. I think I would have
fudged on that assignment, had it been assigned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I gather from your testimony you certainly do not consider yourself
a Communist.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I certainly do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And quite the contrary.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us what your activities&mdash;you are a member of the American
Civil Liberties Union?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What have been your activities in connection with that organization?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Primarily to send in my membership fee each year. I have been
a member for some years prior&mdash;that is to say, going back to the time prior
to my marriage. I have recently, perhaps a year ago, became on the membership
committee for the local chapter in Dallas. That chapter, I might say,
only just opened a year and a half ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And have you, as part of those activities, sought to enlist others
to become members of the American Civil Liberties Union?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have talked to perhaps half a dozen people, to encourage them;
yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever discuss this organization with Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you told us in your testimony up to this moment all of
your discussion of that organization with Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I have. I call your attention to my testimony of a conversation
with Lee over the phone saying that I thought that if he was losing
his job because of his political views, that this would be of interest to the Civil
Liberties Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did any of those discussions embrace the question of what
possible help this organization might be to him if he got into trouble eventually?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My judgment is that he took that statement I have just referred
to as an implication of the possibility of help from that organization to him
personally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With reference particularly to the possible need at any time
for counsel?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He may have assumed such a thing. My understanding of the
Civil Liberties Union is that they are not interested in just defending people,
but in defending rights or entering a case where there is doubt that a person's
civil liberties have been properly upheld.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or might be?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Or there might be such doubt; yes. I wouldn't know whether
Lee understood that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At least your discussions with him do not enable you to proceed
to the point at which to enable you to voice any opinions in this area
or subject than you have now given?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you aware of the name John Abt before you received the
telephone call you testified about from Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I had not heard that name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, therefore, you never suggested it to Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are a modest person, but could you indicate for us how
fluent you are or you think you are in the command of the Russian language?
Please don't be too modest about it. Be as objective as you can.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is a very hard thing to describe, but I might start by saying
that I have perhaps an 8 or 10-year-old's vocabulary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are using as an example the vocabulary of a native Russian
citizen of the age of 8 to 10 years old?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I do not have that much fluency. If the subject I am
talking about is something in which I have developed a vocabulary&mdash;and
these subjects are mostly in terms of home or the things that one does&mdash;then
I can proceed with an ability to convey my meaning. If it gets into anything
technical which would use terms such as insurance or taxes, I have to look it
up. I approach any writing of a letter with some dread, as it is difficult for
me. I might say in this connection that I presume to teach Russian, not
because I am fluent, but because I think my pronunciation is particularly good
for a nonnative, and because I have gone the route of the beginning student
and know how to do this, and have thought a great deal about what helps a
person to learn. I would not presume to teach English to people who didn't
know the language, though I am fluent in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; you are.</p>

<p>You used a 10-year-old comparison as to vocabulary. What would you say
as to your Russian grammar&mdash;that is, command of the technicalities of grammar?
Would it be superior to an 8-to 10-year-old?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My <span class="locked">vocabulary&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I mean sentence construction.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. An 8-to 10-year-old would do better than I do in actual conversation,
but would not be able to give you the names of parts of speech as I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
in Russian. I have a book knowledge of grammar in Russian. But this doesn't
prevent me from making more mistakes than an 8-or 10-year-old would make
if he grew up native to the language&mdash;many more mistakes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you say that is true of your writing&mdash;that is, when you
compose a letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My writing would be with fewer mistakes, because I can think
about it more in putting it down, but still very many mistakes occur in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you say your fluency in the command of the Russian
language as of the time you first met the Oswalds in February of 1963 was
comparably about the same as your fluency with that language now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have improved, particularly over the period of 2 months that
Marina was at my home&mdash;I have improved my ability to converse, and certainly
increased my vocabulary very markedly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your experience with Marina has served to improve your command
both of vocabulary and of the use of the language generally?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How fluent was&mdash;I will put it this way. How would you judge
the command of Lee Oswald of the Russian language, both as to vocabulary
and as to sentence construction, and grammar generally?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He had a larger vocabulary than I do in Russian. He had less
understanding of the grammar, and considerably less regard for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was not sensitive to the delicacies of the language?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He didn't seem to care whether he was speaking it right or not,
whereas I care a great deal. He did read&mdash;he certainly subscribed to the things
that I have described. And my impression is that he did read them some, and
that he did not shy away from reading a Russian newspaper as I do. I find
newspaper reading still very hard, and magazines, also. I have to do a great
deal of dictionary work to get the full meaning of a magazine or newspaper
article.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you think that is because you are a sensitive perfectionist as
far as the language is concerned? You wish to read it and use it in its finest
sense, and you avoid what I would call, for example, pigeon English use of
Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would rather communicate than avoid pigeon use, and I have
to use broken Russian to communicate. In reading, I would say what I have
described as my reading&mdash;it is just that I don't have a very large vocabulary&mdash;not
that I want to understand every nuance of the words that I am reading.
I just can't get the meaning reading it off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yet you found that Lee was inclined to plunge ahead, as near
as you can tell?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I gathered so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Marina ever say anything about Lee Oswald's command
of the Russian language, or his use of it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; she did. Let me preface my answer by saying she did not
correct him, or at least not very often. She commented at one time in the
fall, after Lee came to the house on a Friday, that his Russian was getting
worse, whereas mine was getting better, so that I spoke better than he did now.
It embarrassed me, is the only reason I recall her saying it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she say it in his presence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; she did. That is why I was embarrassed. I did not know
whether it was correct or not, and she had intended it as a compliment, but it
was at the same time unkind to him. So this is why I was embarrassed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us everything you learned about Oswald's sojourn in
Russia, first from direct statements you heard him make&mdash;and this will be in
addition to anything you have already told us.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can't recall anything that hasn't appeared in my testimony.
And there is very little that has appeared in my testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; I appreciate that. Did he ever say anything about&mdash;I think
you did testify a little bit about this yesterday&mdash;his efforts to obtain a passport
to return to the United Slates, and his difficulties in that connection?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My recollection is that it was she who told me of this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And she rather than Lee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Calling upon your recollection, is there anything you have not
testified to on that particular <span class="locked">subject&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Of things he had told me himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is right. That emanated from him.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't think of anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I will then ask you the same question as to Marina&mdash;that
is, tell us everything else you can think of that you have not already told us
that you learned about Lee Oswald's sojourn in Russia, that you might have
learned through Marina.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I did learn that they applied for a passport for all of
them, that it was a long time coming&mdash;no particular length of time mentioned.
That they went to Moscow first and then by train, I gather, to Holland, and
then by boat to New York City, stayed there a day or less, and came directly
to Fort Worth. She mentioned to me, as I testified, that they had borrowed
money for the payment of their steamship passage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Borrowed it from the State Department?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall that she mentioned from whom. Just that they
had borrowed it and paid it back. She said that Lee had an apartment by himself
in Minsk, which was unusual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she say it was unusual?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; she said it was unusual. That, in fact, it caused a little bit
of resentment from those who didn't have so much privacy. And I gather that
she moved into it after they were married.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is a fact, at least according to her testimony.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have spoken to some extent of her aunt and uncle&mdash;that she
lived there. Is this relevant to your question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; it is relevant to Representative Ford's question, which I
ghosted to you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She liked her aunt very much, and commented to me several
times that it was interesting that this particular aunt was no blood relation
at all&mdash;it was the uncle that was the blood relation. But that this aunt was
her favorite aunt. And they had many good conversations. Marina would go out
on a date, and then come back and tell the aunt all about it. Marina commented
that the aunt did not work, which she also said was unusual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Unusual in what sense?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That most women in Russia both did work and had to financially.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that&mdash;did you infer from that that her uncle had a position
in Russia that enabled him to supply funds so that his wife did not have to
work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was the impression it left me with, yes.</p>

<p>She also said of her aunt that her aunt kept her floors spotless, and her
whole house beautiful all the time. You want all the recollections I have of
their time in Minsk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Anywhere in Russia.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Including her family background?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I knew because I had filled out forms for her at Parkland
Hospital that she was born at Archangel. From conversation with her, I know
she was born 2 months early.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was a 7-month baby, somewhat premature?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; and her mother had bundled her up in great swaths of
clothing to bring her from Archangel to Leningrad, when she was a tiny baby.
I learned that the grandmother had been with her, I judge later in Archangel,
when they lived there again, and was part of her upbringing. Her mother had
some medical job&mdash;I never did understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean job in the sense of position?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Position. I never did understand how responsible this was&mdash;whether
she was a medical doctor or what her position was. Marina described
the time when her mother died of cancer, and that also her grandmother died
before the year was out of cancer, also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she ever speak of her father?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She said that her father had died when she was very tiny,
that she did not know her father, that she was raised by her mother and stepfather,
and she did not know until it came out from something a neighbor let
drop, when she was already in her early teens, that this man she thought to be
her father was not in fact her father but her stepfather. This came as a shock
to her. I knew that she had a younger brother and sister, Tatyana, I think,
Tanya would be the diminutive. I don't recall her brother's name. It is my
impression that she liked Leningrad, was proud of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she ever say why she went from Leningrad to Minsk, or
the circumstances under which&mdash;which surrounded her going from Leningrad
to Minsk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; she never did. She did say that some people commented to
her that it was strange to be leaving Leningrad, because there were many
people who wanted to work in Leningrad who evidently didn't have the necessary
priority or permission to get into the city to work there. She having been
brought up there had the right to live there and work there. But this was
the first I knew that you could not just move from one city to another in Russia
if you wanted to look for work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have a discussion with her from time to time about
the fact that you could move about in Russia only by permission.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, she mentioned&mdash;and I think I have said so&mdash;that you don't
go to a different city in Russia without its being known. You have to register
immediately upon coming to the city, show all your papers, and then the government
assigns you your quarters&mdash;hotel or apartment or any room. You
cannot get a place to spend the night if you don't sign in. Which is certainly
a far cry from our situation in this country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she indicate any reaction on her part to the difference&mdash;that
difference in America as compared with Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was not overtly stated. She did make clear to me that she
thought the consumer goods here were superior to those in Russia. She said
that very likely this was in part due to the fact that people are not sure of their
jobs. In Russia you can do a bad job and still remain employed; whereas here
she said a person had to produce good work or they didn't stay on the job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was a comment on her part on the difference in the system?
Russia from that in the United States?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she indicate any reaction to that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She thought the system here produced much better goods, and
she was pleased with that. She also commented that things were much more
available in this country than they were in Russia. She was impressed, for
instance, with the fact that my neighbor offered to loan things for the baby,
and my friend Mrs. Craig offered to loan things for the baby. She said that
in Russia people were not so sure that they could replace things that they had
loaned or given away. You could not go to the store when you needed to have
baby clothing and necessarily find it there. So there was much less&mdash;for that
reason, and others&mdash;there was much less loaning and sharing of things than
she found here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she say anything about the period when Lee was hospitalized
in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And her visiting him every day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have no clear recollection. I do, of course, recall her description
of her own pregnancy, and the birth of June in the Minsk hospital. That
Lee was in the hospital rings very faintly. I cannot think of anything he was
in there for. I have completely forgotten any reference to it&mdash;I am not sure
I remember now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have we exhausted you on that subject?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am exhausted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is your reaction on the subject of Marina's reaction in
turn to her husband? Did she love him? What was her opinion of him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I think it has already appeared pretty thoroughly in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
testimony that she both asked herself did she love him and did he love her, and
proceeded with the feeling that she had committed herself to this, and would
try to do her best for the marriage&mdash;not without occasionally wondering whether
this marriage would last, or should.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have any opinion or reaction on this subject&mdash;as to
whether she had perhaps at times contributed to some degree or had been at
fault to some degree in provoking what outbursts there were on Lee's part and
his sometimes crudeness and abruptness with respect to her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, as I think I have testified, she didn't try, or certainly did
not try all the time, to avoid a confrontation or an argument or disagreement.
But she did argue with him and uphold her own views, rather more forcefully,
at least in her skill in the language, than Lee, on some occasions. I would say
that if he had been a more relaxed and easy-going person, somebody that was
not so touchy, that her behavior would not have been any difficulty to the
marriage. Rather it was a healthy thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There is an opinion at large, at least among some of us here in
the United States who have pursued Russian literature and published works
on the Russian people and the Russian character, that there is a tendency or
an element on the part of the Russian to exaggerate and to present the bizzare.
Do you have any feeling or opinion on that subject with respect to Marina
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I do think that there is such a thing as a personality formed
by the Russian background, and it is a different influence, but also operating,
the Soviet system. But it is hard for me to describe what that is. And I
would not have included the statement you just made of attempting to exaggerate
or bizzare&mdash;is that the way you put it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Rather I would say it is a moodiness and a quality of enigma.
Not the open-faced, glad-handed Texan or frontier American, but much more
subtle. And I also do think that there is much more tendencies to&mdash;among
Russian emigrés to suspect underlying motives, and things going on beneath the
surface that are not evident on the face of the situation, a tendency among
them more than among Americans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you find in Marina any of these tendencies you now relate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I find her moody. I would say she was contrary to this that I
have described, of some Russian people, of a quality of suspecting things going
on under the surface.</p>

<p>I found this quality rather in the head of the Russian school at Middlebury,
who picked up my tape recorder and took it to his office one time when I had left
it in the hall. He evidently thought I had bad use intended for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you say that&mdash;give us your opinion as to Marina's sense of
the truth, of telling the truth, having a feeling of the truth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is difficult to say, because what questions I have about her
telling of the truth have all arisen since I was with her personally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; I wish your opinion now, as of this time.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You wish my opinion now?</p>

<p>It is my opinion that this sense of privacy that I have described interferes
with her being absolutely frank about the situation, and that she may, because
of this lack of frankness, describe a situation in a way that is misleading, not
directly false&mdash;but misleads the hearer. And this, I would say, not always in
conscious design, but some of it happening quite without preplanned intent.
I conclude that from the fact that I think she must have known that Lee had
been to Mexico, judging from the materials I have already described were
picked up by Mr. Odum and myself from the dresser drawer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From that, you conclude what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, that she was willing to mislead by implication. And I would
judge that she knew about the application for a passport, and this was never
mentioned. All the times that she mentioned that she might have to go back
to Russia, the implication was that she alone was going back. And this doesn't
appear to have been fully the case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What leads you to say that&mdash;it wasn't fully the case in what
sense?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, in the sense that Lee had at least applied for a passport
to get him to Russia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are rationalizing from the fact that you know now that he
applied for a passport?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You conclude from that that she must have known of that
application and the fact that he received it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And, of course, that is rationalization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is the only basis on which you make that statement? That
is what I am getting at.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I think that is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is your opinion as to whether Marina Oswald would tell
the truth and the whole truth under oath in response to questions put to her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would expect that she would make a dedicated attempt to tell
the truth. Just looking at the amount of time I have testified, as opposed to the
amount of time she testified, relative to the amount of things she knows and the
amount of material that I have that is of any use to the Commission, she could
not have yet told the whole truth, just in terms of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, that may be affected&mdash;of course, you must understand&mdash;by
the questions put to her and the subjects that were opened on her examination.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But subject to that, it is your feeling that she&mdash;there is <span class="locked">a&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Subject to that, I really cannot answer. I don't know what her
attitude is towards her situation, which is a rather remarkable one in this case.
I would guess that it is helpful to her telling the whole truth that Lee is now
dead. I might say I am affected in that judgment by having been present when
she could not positively identify her husband's&mdash;what was thought to be his
rifle at the police station, whereas I read&mdash;and perhaps it is not so&mdash;but I read
that she positively identified it here at the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you were present when she, in your presence, was unable to
identify with reasonable certainty that the weapon exhibited to her was her
husband's rifle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you attribute that largely to the fact that his now being
deceased has in her mind released her, so that she may without fear of implicating
him, were he alive, to speak fully her opinions on subjects such as that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That would be my opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. Did she ever express any fear of Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; she never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she ever express to you any fear that he might do something,
and I use the vernacular again, crazy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I think we have covered this, but to be sure, did she ever mention
to you that Lee had anything to do with the Walker incident?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That she suspected it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, since you are now aware of what has come out with respect
to that, does that also affect your opinion as to her sense of truth or sense of
frankness?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, it affects my opinion on how close we were as friends. I
never asked her to be frank or discuss such a subject, of course, because I would
not have known to bring it up. Not telling me about something is quite different
from telling me something that is misleading to the whole truth of the situation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In other words, are you seeking to imply that her failure to
mention the General Walker incident and Lee Harvey Oswald part in it, if he had
any part, that that was understandable to you&mdash;that would be understandable
as of that time, having in mind your relations with her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; it is not understandable to me. I feel it is only explained&mdash;the
only explanation I can find, when I look for one, is that she did not feel
terribly close to me, or did not know just what I would do with such information.
She may well have suspected that I would feel it necessary to take immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
action, and I would have felt that necessary if I had known this. She may have
felt that Lee would not make such an attempt again, and that there was therefore
no need to bring it up. I don't know whether your accounts of what the
FBI has put down of their conversations with me include one meeting with Bardwell
Odum, right after the newspapers had indicated something of a shot at
Walker, before there was any corroborative details, such as the content of a note.</p>

<p>I was very depressed by the feeling that here&mdash;not to me, but to someone, this
man had shown that he was violent and dangerous, and the information had been
so close to me and not available to me&mdash;and I deeply regretted that I had had
no warning of this quality in him.</p>

<p>And I further went on to say that I felt that it was a moral failing on her part
not to speak to someone about this, because I thought she would surely realize
that this was an irrational and extremely dangerous act on his part&mdash;that he
needed help and/or confinement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is your personal attitude towards the Castro regime?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have very few opinions about it. I suspect that the press is
correct, that it is used as a jumping off ground for people, for Communist deputies
going to Central American countries, trying to stir up trouble. That I object
to strenuously. That the people of Cuba had Castro as a leader is not of any
particular offense to me. I do think that he has rather more popular support
than his predecessor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Batista?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes&mdash;which is not saying a great deal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I think Representative Ford might have had more in mind
as to whether you share or do not share or have an aversion to what you understand
to be the Castro regime.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think the regime is clearly dictatorial, that it seeks to perpetuate
itself, and to do so at all costs; and that I certainly object to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, do you consider the Castro regime as you understand it, that
it is liberal or reactionary?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know as I can put a term on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have any thoughts and assumptions on your part as
to what Lee Oswald was doing after Marina returned with you from New
Orleans? You have already testified that you thought from what he said
about seeking employment in Houston and Philadelphia that he was engaged in
that immediately following period in attempting to secure employment in
Houston.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that the extent of your impression as to that period&mdash;that is
the period from the time you left on the 23d of September and the time he
showed up without advance notice on the 4th of October?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was my impression that he had been looking for work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you had no other impression?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. During the period that Marina lived with you, did you ordinarily
arise at an early or a late hour? When did you ordinarily arise?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Are you asking did I arise earlier than she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No. I am asking when you did. Then I will ask you when
she did.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I usually got up around 7:30 or 8.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did she arise?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. A similar time. When the babies permitted, she would sleep a
little later. She changed her schedule to fit ours rather more than her schedule
would have been if it had been just the way she had done in her own apartment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In her own apartment you think she would have arisen later
or earlier?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She would have arisen later and let the baby, June, stay up
later, and therefore be able to sleep later in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. But while she was at my home, she endeavored to fit herself
into the sleeping schedule of myself and my children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you told us about your knowledge of any and all correspondence
that she received at your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think I have. The only thing that I recall is that she got
a letter from a girl friend, Galya.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she ever show you any correspondence she received?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This has been covered. I don't know if it has been covered
in the thrust that Representative Ford has in mind.</p>

<p>Do you believe that Marina had any Communist sympathies when she reached
this country, and if so, what is your belief as to whether she retained them
after living in this country?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I do not believe she had Communist leanings when she arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is it your belief that she is of the same viewpoint now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you now told us all of the activities about which you know
anything in which Lee Oswald and you or you and your husband or Lee and
Marina and you and your husband took part?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Let's see if I understand you. All the activities in which my
husband and/or I were with any of the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Either of the Oswalds, together or separately.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To the best of my recollection, you have a full account.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever attend any meetings together&mdash;that is either you
and Lee on the one hand, or you and Marina on the other, or you and Marina
and Lee together?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There is just the one of my husband and Lee at the Civil Liberties
Union meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you named all of the friends and associates or even acquaintances
that you had in common with the Oswalds or either of them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you really have any common interest?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. With Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, any common interest with Lee&mdash;did you have any?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; not really.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And any activities with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Car driving teaching.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's about all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the same question as to Marina. Have you told us everything&mdash;I
will put it this way. Have you told us everything about any common
or concerted action or interest between yourself on the one hand and Marina
on the other?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Marina and I of course had a great deal of common interest
in children. I think she read to me from a book on child care in Russian
that she had&mdash;or perhaps I have not said that. Do you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I am not too sure. I think you have intimated it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And we discussed child raising, care, diet, all the things that
come up in connection with children.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you had no common&mdash;you had no community activities with
either of them, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No&mdash;that's right. You mean which took us to a group with other
people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Other groups, civic activities generally.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or women's clubs or meetings of that character. She occasionally
accompanied you on your visits to Mrs. Roberts, I assume.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But there was no plan or direction to those activities.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. None.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you told us everything you know about Lee's income and
sources of funds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall an occasion when you had a conversation with
Marina&mdash;it would have to be on the 23d of November&mdash;about the blanket package
and the gun in the package?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. On the 23d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have one&mdash;I will put it this way. Did you have
any conversation with her on that subject, other than the one you have related
that occurred in the presence of the police officers in your home on the 22d
of November, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. None that I recall; nor the day following, either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that the only time that you ever had a conversation with
Marina dealing with the presence of a firearm in your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is the only thing I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or Lee Oswald's ownership of a firearm?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; the only time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or use of it.</p>

<p>I take it from the answers you have given to my long line of questioning
that you never detected or saw Lee Oswald doing any dry firing or dry sighting
of a rifle in Irving, Tex. in or about your home or premises.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That concludes the questions Representative Ford had in mind.</p>

<p>I will look through the tag end of these notes and I think we have reached the
end.</p>

<p>You have no diary of events during the time of your contact with the Oswalds
other than the calendar diary which we have now introduced in evidence.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. None.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you never kept any?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In connection with his seeking work in Houston, Tex., in the
course of that conversation with you girls in New Orleans, when he made the
statements you have related about seeking employment in Houston, was there
anything said by him as to having any acquaintances or friends in Houston?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I believe I have already answered that&mdash;that he said he
had a friend in Houston, and that I was not sure whether that was so or
not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He did not identify the friend?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I was curious, though, about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say anything about having any connections or friends
in Philadelphia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But he did mention the possibility of seeking employment in
Philadelphia.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He mentioned Philadelphia as a possibility that he might go
and look.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall a long-distance call received by Marina while she
was at your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was a call which I have related from Lee to her from
New Orleans on May 9th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you know of no other?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I cannot think of any other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever hear anything by way of discussion or otherwise
by Marina or Lee of the possibility of his having been tendered or at least
suggested to him a job at Trans-Texas, as a cargo handler at $310 per month?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I do not recall that. $310 a month?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes. This was right at the time that he obtained employment
at the Texas School Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And he was definitely offered such a job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I won't say it was offered&mdash;that he might have been able
to secure a job through the Texas Employment Commission as a cargo handler
at $310 per month.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I do recall some reference of that sort, which fell through&mdash;that
there was not that possibility.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Tell us what you know about that. Did you hear of it at the
time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would you please relate that to me?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recall some reference <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did it come about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. From Lee, as I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was it at the time, or just <span class="locked">right&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was at the time, while he was yet unemployed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And about the time he obtained employment at the Texas School
Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It seemed to me he went into town with some hopes raised by
the employment agency&mdash;whether a public or private employment agency I
don't know&mdash;but then reported that the job had been filled and not available
to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But that <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is my best recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of his report to you and Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you do recall his discussing it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recall something of that nature. I do not recall the job itself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I hand you a document, Mrs. Paine, marked Ruth Paine Exhibit
469, entitled "Translation from Russian."</p>

<p>(The document referred to was marked Ruth Paine Exhibit 469 for identification.)</p>

<p>It appears to be a note from you addressed to "Dear Marina" signed "Ruth."</p>

<p>Having examined that document, is the note of which that purports to be a
translation familiar to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is familiar to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you prepare and transmit the original?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you do that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was some time after the assassination. This note accompanied
a group of letters originally addressed to me, but which carried enclosures
for Marina which I took to the Irving police and they transmitted to
the Secret Service, and thence to Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. I offer in evidence as Ruth Paine Exhibit 469 the
document that has been so marked. Would you look at that. Having examined
that, may I ask you a question or two about it.</p>

<p>Has my questioning of you this morning and your testimony of today and
previously, and your examination of various documents refreshed your recollection
as to additional motivation, that is in addition to what you have already
given, for your undertaking the study of the Russian language?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, examination of that letter which I completely had forgotten.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Having <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It sounds like a very valid <span class="locked">description&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Having that to refresh your recollection, do you wish to add to
your testimony as to your motivation in studying Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I can explain two phrases I did not understand when you
used them without the rest of the paragraph. It is a socially useful interest&mdash;and
then I go on to say, "By this I mean I get a great deal of excitement out of
talking with these young friends," and I mention some.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this is a document, a letter you wrote your mother, when?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This is written June 7, 1957, according to the date on it. I enjoyed
the contact with these friends, and our common interest in Russian
exchange.</p>

<p>Then also the reference to its being an intellectual decision&mdash;I am opposing
intellectual decision to the initial leading or calling to study the language,
which was not intellectual but a felt thing. Then the decision to study specifically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
Russian&mdash;as it says right here, "The decision to study Russian specifically
is an intellectual decision" which came after the leading. That is something
I thought out, that kind of intellectual&mdash;rather than a prompting from within.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And when you use the expression&mdash;you Quakers use the expression
that you have a leading&mdash;you mean a prompting from your&mdash;inner
prompting.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I would like to confirm with you, if I can, Mrs. Paine&mdash;your
recollection is that Lee Oswald had come home on the evening of November 8,
and that it was the following day, the following morning, the 9th, that you
took him, with Marina, to the driver's license application bureau.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that it was some other weekend that he did not come on
Friday, but came on Saturday morning.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That that is your present recollection.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. I will support it by saying that he used my typewriter
before he went to the driver training location.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, when you say you have a recollection of his having used
your typewriter, you mean the evening before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I mean the morning before. But that would have had to be
fairly soon after breakfast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mean in the morning before you left for the driver's license
bureau, he used your typewriter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was the morning of the 9th, before we left for the driver training
bureau. And I am just saying that if he had come in on Saturday, I doubt
it would have been that early.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. So that tends to confirm your own recollection that he
had come to your home the night before as usual.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That he arose in the morning, and used your typewriter, and
then you all departed for the driver's license bureau.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you take him to the parking lot for instruction on more than
one occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About how many?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There were at least two. I think probably just two. And add
to that one occasion when we practiced only in front of the house, just parking.
Three lessons altogether.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there an English-language dictionary on your desk secretary
at the time you found what I call the Mexico letter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, there was&mdash;a pocket dictionary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that an English-Russian, or <span class="locked">just&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Just English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that your dictionary or was it his?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was not mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know of any reason why&mdash;I will restate the question.</p>

<p>Do you have any inward feeling or any hunch or anything along those lines
that Robert Oswald might have taken a dislike to you or to your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have no feeling of that sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Nothing has occurred to lead you to have that feeling?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Except your question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Pardon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Except your question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, other than my question. That is the trouble with leading
questions.</p>

<p>Do you recall whether at any time in your home Lee Oswald had viewed any
movies of the assassination of&mdash;fictional assassination of a President or anyone
holding high public office?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I do not recall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall at any time during the period he was in your
home that you saw such a movie on television?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I know I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You mentioned yesterday, I believe it was, you recalled his
looking at&mdash;late one evening&mdash;at a spy movie on television.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. I think German World War II variety.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is your recollection that you did not ask Mrs. Randle to call
the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is my clear recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There was no refusal on the part of Mrs. Randle to do so.
I am afraid it follows if you did not ask her, there was no refusal.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It certainly does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am trying to awaken again your recollection of that incident.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, there is no recollection whatever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of that sort of thing having occurred in the course of that
discussion.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Of that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall whether or not Mrs. Randle, as a friendly
gesture&mdash;her suggestions were friendly, were they not, in connection with his
securing employment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she mention the Manner Bakery?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Possibly; yes. I do recall saying that Lee doesn't drive, making
the point that this was a hampering thing for him. And, of course, therefore
it made it impossible for him to drive a truck for the Manner Bakery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And in that connection, had she mentioned the Texas Gypsum
Co.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At least you do recall that it was impractical to consider possible
positions which would require him to operate an automobile.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. I believe I do recall a reference now to driving a truck,
delivery truck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Harkening back to the meeting at Mr. Glover's apartment or
home on the 22d of February 1963, do you recall whether Lee Oswald said
anything about whether he was a Communist?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall him saying anything of that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say anything about any attempt on his part to join the
Communist Party while he was in Russia?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he did not. I did not listen to everything he said that
evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall an incident in which there was a telephone call
by Col. J.&nbsp;D. Wilmeth to your home, in which he spoke with Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you tell us about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would say this was a week or less before the assassination.
He called and asked&mdash;he called from Arlington, Tex., which is between Fort
Worth and Dallas, and asked if he could come over some time <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would that be a nontoll call?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was a toll call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To talk with Marina, that he had heard she was living at my
house, and was interested in speaking with somebody who spoke natively.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he speak with you on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are recounting, then, your conversation with him, and in
turn his conversation with her, as she might have reported it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you completed all you wish to say about that incident?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. Are you going to ask me if he came?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I put the question as to what you wished to say. Have you
completed your full recollection of the incident?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is my recollection of the phone call. He then did come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And when did he come?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My recollection is that he asked to come&mdash;that he worked at
Arlington State College on Tuesdays and Thursdays; that he called us on
Tuesday and asked to come Thursday, and we said Thursday was not the best
time, and he&mdash;and we agreed upon the following Tuesday.</p>

<p>My best judgment is that he actually came then on the 19th of November.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. And how long did he stay?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, perhaps an hour. And I cannot even recall exactly what
time, except I think it was right in the middle of when we should have been
making dinner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he visit with both you and Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And were arrangements made for his return on another occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I cannot recall that we made a specific date, but we certainly
planned to get together again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was this strictly a social call?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it was. An interest in the language motivated his coming.
He is a teacher of Russian at Arlington State College.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Let's see. Lee Oswald was not home on that occasion.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I mean he was not in Irving on that occasion.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, I have only one more question.</p>

<p>Do you wish to add anything, or has anything occurred to you which you
have not up to this moment testified to with respect to the Oswald incident
and this great tragedy which my questions and the questions of the members
of the Commission have not heretofore elicited, and which you think might be
helpful to the Commission in its work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, you have not yet asked me if I had seen anything of a note
purported to be written by Lee at the time of the attempt on Walker. And I
might just recount for you that, if it is of any importance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; I wish you would&mdash;how that occurred. Tell me all you
know about it&mdash;all you knew about it up to and including November 22.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I knew absolutely nothing about it up to and including November
22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there any explanation or anything that you feel you ought
to say or wish to say about that incident?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, just that I was shown a portion of a note by two Secret
Service men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was after November 22?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It certainly was. Perhaps a week later. I had sent Marina
one of these small collections of letters, such as I have described, that includes
notes to her and donations, and left such with the Irving police. And on one
occasion left also a couple of books which were hers. I referred to the fact
that she read to me from a child care book. One of these was a book from
which she had been recently reading to me, and she used it much as I had
used Benjamin Spock's "Baby and Child Care" when my babies were small&mdash;that
is constant daily reference. And I thought she would want to have it
with her.</p>

<p>I believe it was probably the next day I got a call from the Secret Service
saying something important had come up in this case, could they come out
and see me. I said yes, of course. They arrived. Mr. Gopadze, of the Secret
Service, who was acting as translator, and I think the other man's name was
Patterson, and he spoke English only&mdash;Mr. Gopadze showed me a piece of paper
with writing on it, a small piece of paper such as might come from a telephone
note pad. He asked me not to read it through carefully, but simply to look
at it enough to tell whether I could identify the handwriting and whether I had
ever seen it before. I said I could not identify the handwriting. I observed
that it was written in Russian, that the second word was a transliteration
from the English word&mdash;that it said "This key"&mdash;using the word "key" rather
than the Russian word&mdash;and went on to say it was for a post office box. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
that is as far as I read. And Mr. Gopadze indicated that it was his impression
that I had sent this note to Marina. And this surprised me. And I <span class="locked">said&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is a masterpiece of understatement, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it certainly is. It astounded me. I said that&mdash;I repeated
that I had not seen it and did not know how I might possibly have sent this to
Marina Oswald. I asked if he thought the note was current, and he did not say.</p>

<p>We went on for some time with Mr. Gopadze&mdash;this in Russian&mdash;saying that
"Mrs. Paine, it would be well for you to be absolutely frank and tell us exactly
what happened" and my saying in turn to Mr. Gopadze, "I am. What more can I
do than what I have said." And finally we went over to English and included
Mr. Patterson in the conversation, and he volunteered this note had been in a
book. Then I realized what must have happened is that I did send Marina
Oswald a book, and described my having sent this to the Irving police and the
Secret Service. And that seemed to clear up the mystery for all of us. And
they left.</p>

<p>Then I don't recall whether this first reference to General Walker having
been shot at was before or after this incident, but I am certain I made no connection
between the two. It was not until it was reported by the Houston
Chronicle that there was a note written by Lee Oswald at the time of the
attempt on Walker's life, and they also reported some of the content of that
note and included a reference to a post office box, that I made a connection to
the note that had been shown me by Mr. Gopadze.</p>

<p>I bring this up because I was irritated by Mr. John Thorne's statement to me
that he thought that I was probably the one to have given the Houston Chronicle
information about this note. I was sufficiently irritated that I called the
Houston Chronicle and spoke to the executive editor, asked if he could tell me
who had given them this information. He said no, he could not. I said that
I was curious, because someone had thought that I had. He said, "We can certainly
tell anyone that you did not." But I don't think Mr. Thorne was interested
enough to have made such a call himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall doing some shopping on the morning of the 9th
after you had gone to the driver's license bureau and found it closed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, we shopped at a dime store immediately adjacent, or in the
same shopping center as the driver's license bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And some few small articles were purchased?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you arrived home when&mdash;about noon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. For a late lunch, I would say. I might say Lee was as gay as
I have ever seen him in the car riding back to the house. He sang, he joked,
he made puns, or he made up songs mutilating the Russian language, which
tickled and pained Marina, both at once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did he do that afternoon, if you recall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he look at television?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My guess is that he certainly looked at television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you leave your home late that afternoon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I went to vote. This would be a trip of perhaps 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he was at home when you left? And was he at home when
you returned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, at any time during that morning drive did you by any
chance stop by a car dealers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Either going to or from the driver's license bureau?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, we did not stop at a car dealers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is your opinion as to whether Lee Oswald could have
been at the Lincoln-Mercury dealership in downtown Dallas on that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think he could not have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he out of your sight other than the period of time it took
you to go to the polls to vote that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is entirely possible that I made a short trip to the grocery store in
the afternoon. But I would say he was not out of my sight for any length of time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In any event, you were conscious of his being in your home or
within your general presence all day.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The entire day. Shall I give what recollections I have for activities
of the 10th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, please.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is my best recollection that this lesson in parking to which I
have referred occurred on the 10th, late in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That is Sunday afternoon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. On Sunday afternoon. I would guess that he had watched pro
football on the television in the afternoon. It was early evening after supper,
and my recollection is that Michael Paine was also at the home. I cannot recall
whether he had had supper with us, but I would guess so. Then I asked the two
men, Lee and Michael, to help me in rearranging the furniture in the living
room. And as I have already said, in reference to my testimony regarding the
note, Commission Exhibit 103, the note referring to Mexico City&mdash;I will add to
that testimony here&mdash;I remembered suddenly that this note was still on the
top of my secretary desk in the living room, preceded the two men into the room,
and put it into my desk. This is the folding front, you know. I just opened
it, put it in and closed it. And then we moved all the furniture in the room
around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The two men were Lee Oswald and your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And on that occasion, you took the note, which is Commission
Exhibit 103, which I call the Mexico note, and you put it inside the secretary.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">And&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. After having left it on my desk for 2 full days, waiting for it
to be picked up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had left it in the same place it was when you first noticed
it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that was out in the open.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you recounted all that occurs to you as pertinent to that
weekend?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have a tape recorder in and about your home during
that period?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Two of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would it have been possible for Lee Oswald, while at your home,
to have made a tape recording?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Wait. I take it back. I had one, a small one, which did not
work well. My best recollection is that Michael's, which would have been
the other, was not there at that time. He was using it at his shop.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So yours was not in working condition and his was at his shop.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At his quarters?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I meant the place of work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At Bell Helicopter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So that it is your opinion that Lee Oswald could not have made
any tape recording.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's my opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it your recollection you were not interviewed by any agent
of the FBI on or about October 27 or on or about October 29, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. If you were interviewed, you are not conscious of it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was certainly not conscious of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it your opinion, based on your recollection of all of the
association of Lee Oswald with you and at your home, that it could not have
been possible for him to have taken a weapon, such as the rifle involved here,
to any range, shooting range, sportsdome, gun range, or otherwise, on any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
occasion when he was in Irving, Tex., residing or staying as a guest in your
home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The only time when he was there and I was away long enough
for him to have gone somewhere and come back, and I now know that I can recall
was Monday, the 11th of November. I have described my presence at the
home on the 9th and 10th. And to the best of my recollection, there was no
long period of time that I was away from the home when he was there. I
may also say that there is no way of getting from my home unless you walk
or have someone drive you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. Paine, was there an occasion or incident in which the possibility of
Marina seeking or obtaining employment in Philadelphia arose?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. When she was with me in May of 1963, we talked briefly about
the possibility of her going with me, accompanying me on my vacation to the
East&mdash;this was before I had plans to&mdash;definite plans to teach for the summer.</p>

<p>She was interested in finding out what sort of job possibilities there might
be for her in New York, Philadelphia, or Washington, where there were larger
speaking Russian populations, and where her knowledge of Russian might be
an advantage rather than a handicap. She was quite excited about this possibility
and wrote Lee a letter in which she referred to it.</p>

<p>After thinking about it, I felt that it was not a good time for her to be applying,
since she would be very clearly pregnant when making such an application, and
I thought she would be apt to be discouraged.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you so told her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And I told her so, after she had written a letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that letter of hers is in evidence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; it is not. She only refers to having written this letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Exhibit 415?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Even I am exhausted of questions, Mrs. Paine. I
want to express to you on the record my personal appreciation of your tremendous
patience. Some of these inquiries, I know, have been quite detailed.
Unfortunately we must make this sort of search. You have been very helpful.</p>

<p>On behalf of myself and the Commission, I express to your our appreciation.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I am very glad to be of help.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We have no further questions as of this time.</p>

<p>Mr. Reporter, we will close this particular deposition.</p>

<p>Mrs. Paine, it is customary, and the witness has the right, to insist upon
reading and signing a deposition. It is also customary for counsel to inquire
whether the witness desires to waive that privilege. And I now put that question
to you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I understand it would be difficult for you to get that typed up
for me to read before going back to Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It would be impossible to get it typed up for you to read before
you go back to Texas, because I understand you are going back to Texas tomorrow,
or Monday morning.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Monday morning. So realizing&mdash;while I would be interested
to read it through, and would hope to sometime, I will waive the right to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you.</p>

<hr />
<h2>TESTIMONY OF RUTH HYDE PAINE RESUMED</h2>

<p>The testimony of Ruth Hyde Paine was taken at 7:30 p.m., on March 23, 1964,
at 2515 West Fifth Street, Irving, Tex., home of deponent by Mr. Albert E.
Jenner, Jr., assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Let the record show that this is a resumption of the deposition
of Mrs. Ruth Avery Hyde Paine, who appeared before the Commission last week
and whose supplemental deposition I took on Saturday.</p>

<p>Since we are in a different jurisdiction now, Mrs. Paine, may I swear you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You may affirm me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Do you affirm that the testimony that you are about
to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To the very best of my ability, I do so affirm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Present at the taking of this deposition is John Joe Howlett,
H-o-w-l-e-t-t [spelling] of the U.S. Secret Service.</p>

<p>We are at the moment in the dining room-kitchen area of Mrs. Paine's home;
is that correct, Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Mr. Howlett and I have measured the rooms in the presence
of Mrs. Paine. The dining room-kitchen area is open. It's full length from
wall to wall is 25 feet and 4 inches in length and 12 feet, 4 inches in width. The
distance from the west wall of the dining room-kitchen area to the outside
wall of the bedroom on the northeast corner is 31 feet, 2 inches. That particular
bedroom in the northeast corner is 12 feet by 12 feet, 1 inch. The southeast
corner of the house consists of a bedroom directly to the south of the first
bedroom I have just described and it is 12 feet, 1 inch by 10 feet, 9 inches. That
particular bedroom opens by window, a large picture window onto West Fifth
Street. The northeast bedroom has two windows, one on the north wall and
one on the east wall. These are unlike the southeast bedroom in that neither
of these windows is a picture window.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The southeast bedroom also has two windows and the picture
window, I think, gives a slightly larger impression than I have of it&mdash;it's around
43 inches wide.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Shall we measure it, then?</p>

<p>(At this point Counsel Jenner and Agent Howlett took the measurements
discussed.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The picture window facing on Fifth Street is&mdash;why don't you
recite it, Mr. Howlett?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Three feet, three inches and four feet, eight inches high.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Three feet, three inches wide and four feet, eight inches high?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's not very wide is it&mdash;39 inches?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, would you be good enough to go outside at the
curb and stand at the place at which the FBI agent's automobile was on, as I
recall your testimony, November 5, 1963, so that we can observe you through
the picture window we have just mentioned and read it in the evidence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I'll do my best.</p>

<p>(At this point the witness, Mrs. Paine, left the house and proceeded to comply
with the request of Counsel Jenner and Counsel Jenner stationed himself in the
bedroom referred to before the window.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Back on the record. Mrs. Paine, I have asked you to locate as
near as you can, to the best of your recollection, the position of the FBI agent's
automobile where he parked on November 5, 1962, when he made his second
visit to you, and have you done so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To the best of my recollection I have to say to you that I cannot
be absolutely certain that the blue Oldsmobile was in front of my house on that
day. I don't remember for certainty. If my husband's other car was being fixed,
it was not in front of the house but that should be easily determined by asking
the repair shop.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would you afford me your best recollection, however, at
the moment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My best recollection is that it was on the street. You now see
Mr. Howlett's car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will describe that and you listen to me as I describe it. I am
now in the southeast bedroom of Mrs. Paine's home, looking out the picture
window facing onto Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On Fifth Street.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And I see two automobiles; first, there is a large&mdash;what is that,
an elm or oak?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is an oak.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. An oak tree&mdash;I would say about 26 inches through, which is
in the center of the lawn in front of the house. We will measure it, John
Joe, and the lawn in due course, but the Secret Service automobile is now
parked at the curb on the northeast street, which is the curb at the Paine
home and directly in front of which is the blue and cream-colored automobile.
Is that a four-door or two-door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know&mdash;I guess it is a two-door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is a two-tone, two-colored car, blue body and a cream-colored
trim, which extends across the hood. The front bumper of Agent Howlett's
automobile is just about touching the rear bumper of the automobile. The
two cars together, or the combined length spans substantially all of the space
between the driveway on the left, which is, I take it, the driveway to the
Roberts' home.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; they are on the other side of the street. It's a home that's
not now used.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The house is not occupied&mdash;that home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It has not been occupied for over a year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That home that I am talking about is the home to the east,
and as the witness has stated, it has not been occupied for a year.</p>

<p>It was unoccupied, then, during the time that Marina stayed with you
last fall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the front end or front bumper of the blue and cream
automobile is just a few feet east of the automobile drive over on the west
side of the Paine premises?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would like to put my children to bed now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Could you wait just 1 second? I wish John Joe would check
me on this standing where I am, looking out this window.</p>

<p>It is impossible&mdash;at least impossible to see any license plate on either of
the two automobiles parked at the curb I have described.</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Yes; that's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, you are shining your searchlight on both automobiles?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. I am shining a flashlight on the front and rear of both
automobiles and you cannot even see the license plate, much less any of the
numbers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You can't even see whether there are license plates, let alone
make out the numbers?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. That's correct, you can't even see the numbers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, we will suspend for your convenience now.</p>

<p>(At this point Counsel Jenner, Agent Howlett, and Mrs. Paine, as well
as the court reporter, left the area of the bedroom heretofore mentioned from
which window the examination was being made of premises outside the window,
Mrs. Paine proceeding to care for her children and Counsel Jenner,
Agent Howlett and the court reporter returning to the dining room-kitchen
area where the deposition is primarily being conducted. Shortly thereafter
Mrs. Paine returned to the area of the taking of the deposition and proceedings
of same continued as follows:)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, you were present when I described the view or
described my observations looking through the picture window first on Fifth
Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, was I accurate in my description of the lot area and the
automobiles parked in front and what could be seen and what could not be
seen in the way of a license plate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; you were accurate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the 5th day of November did an agent of the FBI
come for a second time to interview you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I didn't recall the day, but I have been told it was that day&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. While you do recall that it was 4 or 5 days after the 1st of
November?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What time of day was it, or night, if it was night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I'm trying to think what else was going on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My best estimate&mdash;it was afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I'll ask you this, it was during the daytime?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it was during the day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is your recollection as to the state of the weather?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was a fair day, and I think it was afternoon, but I'm not
sure&mdash;absolutely certain of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By the way, was it Agent Hosty?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it was. He had someone else with him that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did the other FBI agent come in with Agent Hosty?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, just barely across the threshold.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did either of these gentlemen give you the license number of
the automobile which they had parked in front of your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; they did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ascertain that license number?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you make any attempt to do so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I made no attempt to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was Marina Oswald in your home on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She was in my home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When they arrived, where was she in your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. When they arrived, she was in the front bedroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was anything said during the whole course of their presence
and even afterward by her, which indicated or led you to believe or by implication
or otherwise, that she had observed the license number on the FBI
automobile?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Nothing was said that might indicate that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or any implication or anything from what you might have drawn
an inference, that she had paid attention to a license number?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Nothing at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did a discussion occur during that conference or interview in
which Agent Hosty made reference to the parking of his automobile on the
occasion of November 1 when he had interviewed you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This is entirely possible. I recall distinctly that I noticed that
they were parked down the street or he was parked down the street on the
first interview, and it seems to <span class="locked">me&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had noticed that at the time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had noticed that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And how did that come to your attention?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think Mr. Hosty may have brought it up, brought it up to his
having talked to my neighbor a previous time. He made the point that he
tried not to be too obvious or upset the neighbors by their visits.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And having that delicacy in mind, he had parked the car down
the street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The first time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The neighbor to whom you refer is Mrs. Roberts?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And her home is next door to the west?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right&mdash;2519.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, we have used the general term "down the street;" which
way was "down the street," to the west or to the east?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. How did we use the term?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You said he said he parked down the street.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall exactly whether it was down&mdash;my best recollection
is that he was parked in front of the house that the Ponders used to live in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The whom?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The Ponders.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. P-o-n-d-e-r-s [spelling]?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. P-o-n-d-e-r-s [spelling]&mdash;Ponder is the name, but it is the brick
house on the southwest corner of Fifth Street <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, that's east.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The southwest corner of the crossing of Fifth Street and whatever
it is&mdash;you know, Westbrook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that the crossroad?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In other words&mdash;yes&mdash;it's directly diagonal from the Randles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it southeast and at a diagonal across the street from your
home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; or, it may have been down the street farther the other
way, or I may be confused with what Mrs. Roberts told me about where he
parked when he first came to talk with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Let me ask you: Did you see his car, his automobile on that
day&mdash;November 1st?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I believe I did&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you watch him leave the premises and just watch the two
men drive away?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was only one the first time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I can't recall. But I would think it likely that I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where was Marina on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She was in the living room with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was she beside you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you both looking out the window?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To the best I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And had you so desired, could you have seen the license plate on
Agent Hosty's automobile on that occasion, to wit, November 1st?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not with 20-40 vision.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have 20-40 vision?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It's 20-40 or 20-50&mdash;I forget.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have an opinion as to whether the license plate could
have been seen with 20-20 vision?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't have an opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Agent Hosty pass in front of your house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, facing as you are, onto Fifth Street, do you have that
recollection now as to whether the FBI automobile passed when Mr. Hosty left
and drove away, did it pass in front of your house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My best recollection is that I had already taken my attention
elsewhere, that I didn't try to notice, and certainly I did not notice whether he
passed in front of the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At any rate, you did not look at the license plate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And seek to ascertain the number?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know whether Marina did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you know whether she could have?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's possible&mdash;she might have if one can see that with normal
vision.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So that on the November 1st date, you are unable to fix definitely
whether she did or didn't, or could or could not have seen the license plate and
the number of Agent Hosty's automobile?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you give us your best judgment in the premises as to
whether she did&mdash;you had some feeling of her presence on that day, have you
not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I certainly didn't see her write anything down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what was your impression, if you had any?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have none.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You just weren't thinking of license plates at all?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you thinking of them on the fifth?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In any event, the automobile of Agent Hosty was parked, as you
say, down the street and some few houses, at least a number of feet away from
your home on the first, whereas, he parked it in front of your home as we have
now noted on the fifth.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I notice you have a bathtub shower?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was Lee Oswald in the habit of taking a shower?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He often took a shower when he arrived home from work on
Friday, when he arrived here from work on a Friday afternoon and before dinner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he take a shower, to your recollection, in the mornings when
he was here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall his having done so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have any recollection as to whether he took a shower in
any event on the morning of November 22?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have no recollection of him at all on the morning of November
22d, except an empty coffee cup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it that, and I should say in the presence of yourself and
Mr. Howlett, that the bathroom is located on the north side of the house in
between the wall of the northeast bedroom and the back wall of the combination
kitchen and dining room area.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Am I correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And when a shower is taken and you are in your bedroom where
you were as I recall on November 22 in the morning, it makes a noise and it's
quite noticeable to you, is it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. If I'm asleep, there are many things that are not noticeable to
me. I do leave my room door open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, apart from whether you were asleep, I just wanted to get
that&mdash;whether you could hear it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would certainly hear it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And does it make enough racket or noise so that it might well
awaken you if it's turned on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; especially that close to morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were not awakened this morning by any shower?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have a recollection as to whether you noticed, when you
performed your own ablutions that morning as to whether the shower had been
employed, that is, was the shower curtain moist or wet?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I made no notice such as that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it likely that had the shower been used you would have
noticed it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I can't say as it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had, I gather, no sense of his presence that morning and his
leavetaking that morning at all until you arose and he was then gone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You heard no moving about on his part prior to your awakening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No moving about on his part at all when I looked when I awoke.</p>

<p>(At this point Counsel Jenner and Agent Howlett took other measurements in
the hallway of the Witness Paine.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Howlett and I have measured the bathroom and it is 5 feet
wide and 8 feet 8 inches long. The hallway running north and south at the
entrance to the 2 bedrooms, using the wall instead of the jamb, 9 feet 6 inches
long, and 3 feet 4 inches wide.</p>

<p>The living room, which faces on Fifth Street and is to the east of the garage
wall and to the west of the hallway, running across to the 2 bedrooms which we
have just measured, and which faces out onto Fifth Street, is 13 feet wide by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
16 feet 8 inches long. Now, Mrs. Paine, I'll stand beside you, if I may, and I
am facing toward Fifth Street, am I not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And we are sitting in the dining room portion of the combination
kitchen-dining room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Directly in front of us&mdash;I am standing right behind you&mdash;on the
left is a doorway entering into your living room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There is a wall between that wall jamb and another door jamb to
the right or west?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that door opens onto what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It goes into the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, John Joe, if you will measure the distance between the
outer edge of the door jamb of the living room door and the door jamb of the
garage door, however, let's get the outside.</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. It would be 1 foot 2 inches from outside jamb to outside jamb.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So that the space <span class="locked">west&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's east, I'm sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The wall spacing and the two door jambs together, separate the
two doors and are of the width which has been recited. Now, before I open the
door, which you say enters into the garage&mdash;by the way, how wide is that?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. It is a 2-foot 8-inch door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And how high?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. It is 6 feet 8½ inches and it would actually be classified as a
6-foot 9-inch door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, is there a light switch on the dining room wall which
lights the light in the garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see a light switch just immediately to the right of the door jamb
of the door leading into the garage; what is that switch for?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It lights the light in the dining area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And on one of the photographs taken by the FBI, that light
switch appeared, did it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would expect so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall that it did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't specifically recall&mdash;I recall the shot which included that
area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That light switch, then, John Joe, let us locate it.</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. It is 4 feet 6 inches from the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is 4 feet 6 inches from the floor and how many inches to the
center of the light switch?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. It is actually about 6¾ inches to the center of the light
switch.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My best recollection is that I did see that switch in the FBI
photograph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, when we arrived, what was the condition of the
garage door as to whether it was opened or closed? That is, the full door
facing onto Fifth Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The outside garage door&mdash;the large one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is closed and has been since you arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the door that is leading into the garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Is likewise closed and has been since you arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. None of us has been in there, including yourself, since I arrived?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I'm going to open the door and observe that first there is
a screen door on the other side of the wall, is there not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Facing the wooden garage door that I have just opened. Now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
I have stepped into the garage and would you come over here, Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there a light switch handy to turn the light on in your
garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; there is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And would you snap it on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. (The witness complied with the request of Counsel Jenner and
turned on the light.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that light switch is immediately to your right as you enter
the garage from the dining room area, is it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, John Joe, would you measure its height from the floor?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. It is also 4 feet 6 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is set with relation to the doorjamb, how many inches?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Six and one-half inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that's to the right of the doorjamb as you enter from the
dining room area?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So, Mrs. Paine, it is within very easy reach&mdash;it's less than a
hand's length away, is it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, we have entered the garage. Let's measure the garage in
the presence of Mrs. Paine, John Joe, and I will now take one end to the
far end of the garage facing onto Fifth Street, and place the tape against the
inside facing of the garage door opening out onto Fifth Street. What is the
length to the dining room wall?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. It is 21 feet 8 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, let's get it across.</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. It is 10 feet 6 inches wide.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, Mrs. Paine, I notice that in the northwest corner of your
garage there appears to be a small storage room, I would describe it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that small storage room is completely enclosed except for
a small opening which does not have a door or cover; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the storeroom is 4 feet 8 inches wide, measuring from east
to west; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it is how many feet and inches deep?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Three feet one inch deep.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Meaning the distance from the back of the dining room area
wall and the outside portion facing of the south wall of the storeroom?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this storeroom, Mrs. Paine, runs all the way from the
floor to the ceiling, does it not, of your garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And I judge&mdash;well, John Joe, we might as well measure that
while we are at it, with the door open, to the floor of the grass to the ceiling?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. From the ceiling to the floor of the grass is 8 feet 3 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, we will measure the opening into the storage room. The
opening itself is 1 foot 8 inches inside wide, and 5 feet 11 inches tall.</p>

<p>Mrs. Paine, in your testimony last week in referring to the blanket-wrapped
package, you located it in two places in your garage, which I will review with
you in a moment; could the package at any time have been placed in the
storeroom?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I suppose so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And if placed in the storeroom, it would not have been open to
view unless you climbed back in there to see; is that correct?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; there is nothing I normally get in the storeroom&mdash;well, no;
that's not strictly so. I hid birthday presents for&mdash;my little girl's birthday
party was on the 16th of November&mdash;in there in the storeroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, that's an interesting development. When you hid
the birthday presents of your daughter, anticipating her fourth birthday on the
16th of November 1963, did you notice at that time the blanket wrapped
package in the storeroom?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, in secreting those presents would you reasonably, necessarily
have noticed that blanket wrapped package in that small storeroom?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think I would have noticed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you remove those secreted birthday gifts from that
small storeroom?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To the best of my recollection some were removed on Friday
evening the 15th, and some on Saturday the 16th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the blanket wrapped package which you have described
last week, in that storeroom on either of those occasions?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And would you have noticed the blanket wrapped package in
that small storeroom had it been there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I surely would have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, Agent Howlett has called my attention to the fact that
there is an opening in the ceiling of your garage which leads up to, as I see it
now, crawl space above the garage which extends, I take it, the length of your
house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, John Joe, what is that&mdash;2 feet by 2 feet?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Roughly&mdash;yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Has that crawl space opening been without a cover for some considerable
period of time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall its ever having had a cover.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you have <span class="locked">occasion&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was a fan in it for a while&mdash;is there now?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. There's an edge of a fan sticking out.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It has been more recently moved over.</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. It's actually 1 foot 9 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Rather than 2 feet by 2 feet. Was that fan in place in the fall
of 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To the best of my recollection it was&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it, however, that that fan is a movable fan?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which you can push up and slide over easily?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you able to do it yourself?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I never have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So, you don't know its heft or weight?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can lift it from the floor, I know that about it, but I have never
tried to lift it with my arms up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is it a fan made for that particular spacing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or, is it really a floor fan that you sometimes use in your home
itself and then sometimes place over that opening to draw the heat out, I guess
it would be, wouldn't it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It's a portable fan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It's a portable fan, and is it your recollection that on the morning
of the 22d of November that fan straddled the opening in the ceiling?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have no recollection one way or the other?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. None.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Since it is portable, it might have been moved back and, if moved
back, the blanket wrapped package could have been stored up there, correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It could have been.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you enter that crawl space at any time in the fall of 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, in particular, did you examine it on the afternoon of the
22d or any time on the 22d of November 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When the police came here on the afternoon of November 22,
did they climb up and look in the crawl space above the ceiling of your house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did not see anyone do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I am only asking while you were present&mdash;while you were present,
did the police look in the storage room we have now described?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To the best of my recollection they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, the length of the garage extends from the Fifth Street
side back to your dining room area, does it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the width of the garage runs from the wall of the living
room to the wall of the house on the west?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would you please go out in the garage and in our presence
put your foot in the spot&mdash;and the two places&mdash;that you noticed the blanket
wrapped package, as you testified last week?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All right.</p>

<p>(At this point the witness, Mrs. Paine, complied with the request of Counsel
Jenner.)</p>

<p>The blanket was lying approximately here from about here&mdash;in front of the
work bench, halfway to the band saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Will you listen to me please: We are approximately in the
center of the lengthwise plane of the garage and there is on the west wall a
work bench. On the work bench is a drill, a South Bend drill, a heavy industrial
type drill, with a number of packages, and then underneath the work bench is
a small desk&mdash;is that a child's desk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; a student desk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And in the knee hole in the center of that desk on the left and
right of which are sets of two drawers is what; what is that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's an ice chest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that ice chest there on the 22d of November?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is the desk underneath the work bench and is the work bench
also&mdash;are all these things now in the position they were on November 22d?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, are they in the position they were substantially from
October 4, 1963, to and including November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They are in the same position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The work bench I have described is at its top 8 feet 1 inch in
length and 2 feet 3 inches wide or deep, extending out from the west wall into
the garage. It's a good substantial work bench, though it is piled high with
various boxes and cartons. Is the top of the work bench in approximately the
same condition now as it was on November 22, 1963, Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. A little fuller.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is it in approximately, in that respect, the condition it was
from October 4, 1963, to and including November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will now measure the distance east and west from the outside
leading edge of the work bench to the east wall of the garage.</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. It's 7 feet 9 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The south edge of the work bench is 8 feet 5 inches from the
inner side of the overhead garage door, which is now in place.</p>

<p>There is a band saw to the south of the work bench also against the west wall
of the garage. It stands&mdash;it looks like a pretty solid piece of equipment and
it stands 5 feet 7 inches high from the floor and the band saw, Mrs. Paine, is a
solid piece of equipment&mdash;metal, that is, resting on the garage floor itself, is it
not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it is, John Joe, how wide a space?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. One foot five inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It's a powermatic band saw that has an identification plate
"Machinery Sales" and the like on it.</p>

<p>The distance from the south edge of the bench to the north edge of the
band saw is what, John Joe?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Two feet eight inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you measure off 45 inches on that&mdash;we have taken a piece
of corrugated box board, measured off 45 inches in length, and I will ask Mrs.
Paine to take that piece of corrugated box board and place it in the position in
which the blanket-wrapped package was.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's it.</p>

<p>(At this point the witness, Mrs. Paine, complied with the request of Counsel
Jenner.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, may I describe for the record, Mrs. Paine has placed that
45-inch corrugated box board in the position she recalls it was when you first saw
it, Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; that's the second time&mdash;it's where it was on November 22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is where it was on November 22d and one end is how many
inches from the base of the band saw, Mr. Howlett?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. It's 8 feet from the base of the band saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that correct, Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. As I recall&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, it extends in a northerly direction 45 inches and ends up
how many inches north of the south edge of the work bench, Mr. Howlett?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. One foot eight inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Mrs. Paine has placed that, is that correct, Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I'm not sure but it wasn't somewhat more to the north. My
recollection is not that clear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But have you placed it approximately as you can best recall,
and that is all we can ask you to do now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How many inches is it out from Mr. Howlett, the front of the
desk underneath the work bench?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. The center of it is about 3½ inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Don't get the center, because the package was wider than that
piece is.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I'll place it where&mdash;where the outside edge is&mdash;where the outside
edge of the package was.</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. The inside edge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which do you say is inside?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Let me take more packages&mdash;I'm trying to refresh my memory as
to where this was. I do recall standing on it, and whether it was when I stood
here or here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When she says, "Here," she is standing, are you not, Mrs. Paine,
facing north with your hand on the southeast corner of the work bench?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you are standing rather near to the work bench?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I'm trying to recall where I saw it on the 22d, but anyway, that
would be the width of the package between those two boards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What is the distance from the bottom of the desk underneath
the work bench to the nearest edge of the package?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Four and one-half inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the distance from the bottom of the desk to the outside edge,
or most easterly edge of the package?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. One foot two and one-half inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, did I ask you, and I just want to make certain, when was
it that you observed the blanket-wrapped package on the floor the second time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I recall the package was on the floor on the 22d, and that
it was not the first time I had seen it there, but I cannot answer just when I
first saw it in that position&mdash;I don't recall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your testimony was, as I recall, that to the best of your recollection
the blanket-wrapped package occurred in two places in the garage.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you noticed it at any time from the 4th of October to and
including the 22d of November 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have now located it as where you saw it&mdash;it will be better
for you to tell us where it was located when you first noticed it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My best recollection is&mdash;I first noticed it somewhere in the vicinity
of the rotary saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, we have a rotary saw which is pushed up against the east
wall of the garage and is located really, on that wall, but between the south edge
of the work bench and the north edge of the band saw; am I correct about
that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; that's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it is a Craftsman saw&mdash;it is also a substantial piece of equipment.
The saw plane or table is how long?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Three feet four inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And how wide?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. One foot nine and one-half inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that stands how many feet from the wall, Mr. Howlett?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. The saw table is 3 feet 2½ inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the distance from the floor to the top of the saw itself, that
is, all of the saw instrument itself?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. It is 4 feet 7 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what is the distance of extension of the saw table, measuring
from the east wall of the garage to the westerly most portion of the saw table?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. It is 2 feet 7½ inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have I located that saw, Mrs. Paine, in your presence so that
the locations I have given are as you have observed accurate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The south edge of the saw table is how many feet and inches,
Mr. Howlett, from the inside facing of the overhead garage door, which is down
in place?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. It is 5 feet 6 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, Mrs. Paine, would you please locate&mdash;take the 45-inch
package and relocate it where you first saw it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't think there is any point in my doing that&mdash;I can't remember
whether it went east or west or north or south.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, regardless of how it was facing, whether east or west or
north or south, where was it when you saw it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I can recall distinctly that the area between the saw table
and the two chests of drawers was filled with boxes of belongings of things that
belonged to Lee and Marina Oswald. The package was either under the saw
table or out in front of those boxes some way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I will locate the things you have described.</p>

<p>The saw table, the height of which has been stated into the record, is suspended
from the floor by 2 by 4 braces, which angle from the east wall of the garage up to
the underside west end of the circular saw table, and except for those two
braces running up from the floor and the saw to the underside of the circular
saw table, there is nothing underneath there.</p>

<p>Was that the condition in which that space was when you noticed the package
on the floor earlier&mdash;the first time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To the best of my recollection it was for the most part&mdash;it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The witness has mentioned two&mdash;what do you call those?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Chest of drawers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They are located 1 foot 6 inches south of the south edge of the
saw table. They are themselves how wide?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Two feet one inch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They are 2 feet 1 inch wide and extend out from the joist of the
garage wall on the east garage wall how many feet, Mr. Howlett?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Two feet five inches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The south edge of the set of chests, did you say these were?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The south edge of the set of chest of drawers is 2 feet 1 inch to
the inside portion of the overhead garage door, which is in place. Now, would
you with that description again state where the package was when you first saw
it, first was the space you said was filled with the goods and wares of the
Oswalds located in the space between the south edge of the saw table and the
north edge of the chest of drawers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. With some overlapping of the area of the saw table.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. With that in mind, tell us where the blanket-wrapped package
was.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I do not have a distinct recollection of where it lay on the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Locate it the best you can.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To the best of my recollection it was partially under the saw
table or out towards the front of their boxes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever see the blanket-wrapped package upended in your
garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I notice a ball of string which I have just taken from a box, which
is on the surface of the work bench.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have testified that the blanket-wrapped package was in
turn tied or wrapped with string?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You think perhaps, around in four places?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was the string of the weight and character of that which I have
in my hand, that is, this ball of string?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It could have been that weight or it could have been as heavy
as this other short piece that's on the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The short piece which Mrs. Paine has picked up and has exhibited
to me, we will mark "Ruth Paine Exhibit No. 270," and we will cut a piece of
the other twine or string and mark that as "Ruth Paine Exhibit No. 271."</p>

<p>(Materials referred to marked by the reporter as "Ruth Paine Exhibits Nos.
270 and 271," for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For the purpose of the record, Mrs. Paine, and John Joe, Exhibit
No. 271 is the lighter and thinner of the two pieces of string which the witness
has identified, is it not?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will state, and will everybody agree with me or disagree with
me, if I misstate the facts that it would be utterly impossible to get an automobile
into this garage in the condition that it is now, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It would be utterly impossible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, is its condition now in that sense substantially the same
as it was on October 4 and from thence forward through November 22, 1963,
Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, as I understand it, Mrs. Paine, you, Marina, and the policeman
came out into this garage on the afternoon of November 22?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you lead the procession into the garage, or did Marina, or
someone with the policeman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I recall saying that most of the Oswalds' things were in the
garage, and I don't recall whether it was a policeman or myself who first entered.
I would guess it had been myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had there been some conversation before you entered the garage
on the subject of whether Lee Oswald had a rifle and was there a rifle located
in the home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was no such discussion before we entered the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the purpose of your entering the garage on that occasion
and the circumstance as to why you entered the garage with the police,
and I take it Marina was with you, was she?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Marina followed. They had asked to search&mdash;I told them that
most of the Oswalds' things were in the garage and some were in the room where
Marina was staying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, trying to reconstruct this situation and to stimulate your
recollection, would you walk into the garage and tell us as you walk in, what
occurred and when the first conversation took place, if any took place, about a
weapon in the premises? Would you start back here at the garage entrance?</p>

<p>(At this point the witness complied with the request of Counsel Jenner,
entering the garage.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it, Mrs. Paine, you and Marina, and how many policemen
were there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Two or three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Two or three policemen walked into your garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And for what purpose?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To see what was in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, for you to point out to them where the Oswald things
were in your garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you entered then and walked east toward the overhead
garage door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's south instead of east.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That's south, I'm sorry; you are right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that garage door in place on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The four or five of you, depending on how many policemen
there were, walked to the place that you have now heretofore described to us
as where the Oswalds' things were located in the main part, however, the
blanket wrapped package was not at <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span> [interrupting]. We didn't get as far as the area where most of
the Oswald things were located.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. You got about what&mdash;halfway into the garage facing
south?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then, what happened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Then, one of the officers asked me if Lee Oswald had a rifle or
weapon, and I said, "No."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This was in the presence of Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were then&mdash;at that point you were standing where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was at that time standing here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And would you remain there&mdash;Mrs. Paine is now standing at
the corner of the&mdash;southeast corner of the work bench about a foot away from
the work bench; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The officer asked me if Oswald had a rifle and I answered, "No,"
to him and he turned to Marina who was standing at <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would you move to where Marina was standing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right here in the middle of <span class="locked">this&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I'll get that out of your <span class="locked">way&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Let's just move that across there. She was standing here facing
south.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was facing you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, she was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the witness is now about a foot in from the north end of
the work bench and to, necessarily, the east work bench.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was standing there facing and looking at you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; she was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you in turn&mdash;your back was to the overhead garage door,
which was in place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you were facing north?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes&mdash;I translated the question, asking Marina if she knew if
Lee had a rifle, and she said, "Yes"&mdash;she had seen some time previously&mdash;seen
a rifle which she knew to be his in this roll, which she indicated the blanket roll.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When she said that, did she point to the blanket roll?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She indicated to me in her language. My best recollection is
that she did not point, so that I was the one who knew and then translated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, she said she had seen a rifle in the blanket wrapped
package?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which you had already noticed some time prior thereto?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And as she described this, I stepped onto the blanket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The wrapped package?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; and then translated to the police officers what she had said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And when you stepped on the blanket wrapped package, did
you feel anything hard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It seemed to me there was something hard in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At that time when you stepped on it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. At that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did it seem like something hard in the sense of a rifle or a tent
pole or anything as bulky as that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think I would say nothing as irregular as a rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In any event, as I recall your testimony, one of the policemen
stooped down and picked up the blanket wrapped package about in its center,
having in mind its length?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And when he did that, did the blanket remain firm and horizontal?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It wilted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It drooped?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It folded.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It just folded, and from that you concluded there was nothing
in the package?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the blanket?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it your recollection that the four string wrappings were still
on the blanket?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you heard no crinkling of paper or otherwise?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, Mrs. Paine, you testified last week before the Commission
that you keep a supply of wrapping paper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where do you normally keep it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. (At this point the witness, Mrs. Paine, left the area of the garage
and returned to the kitchen-dining room area.) I keep it as I explained at
the Commission hearings, in the bottom drawer of a large secretary desk in
the dining area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have just leaned down and taken a tube of what looks
like wrapping paper from that drawer, have you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, is that the remains of the tube of wrapping paper that
you had in your home on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, this is a new one, similar to the old one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you purchase it at the same place that you purchased the
previous wrapping paper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I purchased the rolls at some dime store.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Howlett, would you measure that wrapping paper?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. It is 2 feet 6 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would I have your permission to take about a yard of this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Take all you want.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I would like to take enough of it so I will get a sheet that is
longer than it is wide. What did you say it was wide?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Two feet 6 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, would you hold one end of that, Mr. Howlett, please.
We will now measure this.</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. That is 3 feet 1 inch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And now, Mrs. Paine, do you have a scissors, and would you
please cut this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>(At this point the witness, Mrs. Paine, cut the paper referred to.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We will mark the sheet of wrapping paper which we have just
cut from a roll of wrapping paper as "Ruth Paine Exhibit No. 272." Would
you mark that, please, Miss Reporter?</p>

<p>(At this point the reporter marked the paper referred to as "Ruth Paine
Exhibit No. 272," for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, all I have to say is that this paper is startlingly
like the wrapping paper that I exhibited to you in the Commission hearing
last week.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is wrapping paper for mailing books and other such articles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is a good weight. You have, I notice, now in your hand, some
sealing tape or paper sticky tape, am I correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From where did you obtain that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. From the same bottom drawer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have a supply of that sticky tape in your home on
November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; this is the remainder of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This is the remainder of a roll you had at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you cut a slip of that for us?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>Miss Reporter, would you mark the strip of sticky tape I now hand you as
"Ruth Paine Exhibit No. 273"?</p>

<p>(Paper referred to marked by the reporter as "Ruth Paine Exhibit No. 273,"
for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, you now have that bottom drawer of your desk
secretary open, and I see the remains of a ball of string.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Two balls of string, one dark brown string and one white string?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As I recall your testimony with respect to the wrappings on
this package&mdash;the string was white string and not the dark brown string?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Does your now seeing the remains of the additional string
you have uncovered from the bottom drawer of your secretary serve to refresh
your recollection, even further, as to whether that was about the weight of
the string on the blanket wrapped package?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It looks rather thin to me, rather thinner than the string on
the package, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. We will take a sample of that, and that will be
marked "Ruth Paine Exhibit No. 274."</p>

<p>(String referred to marked by the reporter as "Ruth Paine Exhibit No. 274,"
for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You also have something that is really rope in your hand now.
Did you obtain that from that drawer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you say that was too heavy or heavier?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would say it is heavier; yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, we will not bother with that in the record.</p>

<p>Mrs. Paine, you recall your testimony with respect to what I called the
Mexico note.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I forget the Commission exhibit number, but that will identify it.
It is a note you found one Sunday morning.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right&mdash;having already noticed it but not having read it the
previous day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, is this the secretary to which you made reference, the desk
secretary&mdash;the piece of furniture from which you have obtained the wrapping
paper, the sticky paper, and the string I latterly described?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; it is not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Where is that desk secretary located?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That desk secretary is in the living room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is the desk secretary in the position now as it was on that
Sunday morning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; it is not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you locate in your living room where that desk secretary
was, if it is not here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was in the middle of the space between the&mdash;the middle of the
north wall of the living room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, the north wall of the living room presently has a sofa or a
couch?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I take it, therefore, that sofa or couch was not in that position?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That sofa has exchanged places with the small desk secretary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the desk secretary is now on the east wall of your living
room; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Please tell me where the television set was on the afternoon of
the day&mdash;on the afternoon of November the 22d when the police called at your
home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was then where it is now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it is now located against the south wall of the living room
between the picture window facing on Fifth Street and the doorway entering
into your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you testified as I recall, that you and Marina were sitting
on the sofa looking at television. Where was the sofa located at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. On the 22d, the sofa was where it is now, as is true of all the
other furniture in the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So, that, therefore, I conclude that from the time on the Sunday
morning that you looked at the Mexico note and made a copy of it and November
22, you had rearranged your furniture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I rearranged it on the evening of the 10th of November&mdash;that
same day that I read the note.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was a Sunday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Lee Oswald and your husband, Michael, assisted you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As I recall your testimony was that before they began to move
the furniture at your request you saw the Mexico note on top of the secretary
and you put it in one of the drawers of the secretary?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I opened the flip front and put it in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Consequently, on the afternoon of November 22, 1963, when you
were looking at television, you and Marina were facing out&mdash;facing toward
Fifth Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were the drapes on your picture window which I see on the
south wall, drawn back?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They were not closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They were not closed?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They were covering perhaps a foot of the window on each side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you so intent, you and Marina, from looking at the television
that you did not notice the police come in to your door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think we could not have seen them coming to the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We were sitting here. I was in the middle of the sofa and Marina
was to the west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. She was to your right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you say you could not have seen them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, there were several times&mdash;I <span class="locked">don't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, at the instant of time they came, had you noticed them
coming?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You say you could not have seen them because, I take it [at
this time Counsel Jenner with the assistance of the witness, Mrs. Paine, drew
the living room drapes so that they no longer covered the living room windows]&mdash;because
they approached the house from the driveway side, which is on the west?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Right, and as I recall, both of the cars that came in were parked
to the west of my driveway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So, they would have come at an angle, which assuming the door
was <span class="locked">closed&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. As it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The door opening onto Fifth Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The door was closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May the record show, and I will ask Mr. Howlett if he agrees,
that under those circumstances, with the officers approaching from the west,
that the ladies sitting on the sofa or couch could not have seen them as they
approached from the west?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So, the first time, I gather you were aware that the police had
arrived or come, was when the doorbell rang or they knocked on the door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The bell rang and I was first aware of them when I opened the
door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, we will get you, Odell, to come in here.</p>

<p>(At this point the reporter proceeded to the point designated by Counsel
Jenner.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will proceed to describe here your lawn and if you, John Joe,
will come out and check me on it and will you stand in the doorway, Mrs. Paine,
and would you check me, Mrs. Paine, as I recite these facts?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All right.</p>

<p>(At this point the persons heretofore mentioned assumed the places designated
by Counsel Jenner.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That your home is well set back, we'll measure it in a moment,
from the street, and it is a rather generous lawn with some bushes, the bushes
are not solid as a screen, but they are up close to your home. The lawn area is
entirely open except for the oak tree which I have heretofore described as being
as a large generous shade tree about 2 feet in diameter. We will measure the
circumference in a moment. John Joe, could we measure the distance from
the south wall of the home to the sidewalk?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. There is no sidewalk&mdash;there is a curb.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; there is.</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. 42 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Will you come in, John, and recite in the presence of the reporter
what that distance is?</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Reporter</span>. I have it in the record from his statement&mdash;42 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There is a roof or canopy over the porch entrance, the depth of
which from the south wall to the south edge of the roof area is what, Mr.
Howlett, to the south edge of the roofed area?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. It would be 11 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it is how wide from east to west?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Seven feet three inches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, is it not true that except for the porch canopy we have just
measured, that the entire front lawn is open?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And unobstructed except for the tree?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, in your testimony you stated that on the late afternoon of
November 21 when you came home, you approached your home from what
direction?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. From the east.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From the east and so you were driving west?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is it not true, as I look facing east now, I can see some
considerable distance of a good block down the street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And I am standing at the doorway entrance to your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About where you were when you first noticed to your surprise
as I recall your testimony, that Lee Oswald was on the premises?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. To the best of my recollection, I had just entered this block&mdash;that's
across Westbrook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Across the cross street which is to the east of your home, which
is named Westbrook?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that's how far?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Three houses down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Three homes down, and out on the lawn was Marina and June,
their child?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then Rachel, I assume, was in her crib or somewhere in the house.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But she was not out on the lawn?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She was not out on the lawn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You pulled up in the driveway?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, Mrs. Paine, off the record, I would like to go into that
a little bit.</p>

<p>(Discussion between Counsel Jenner and the witness Mrs. Paine off the
record at this point.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. On the record. You came home that evening, you
sighted your home and saw Lee Oswald out on the lawn, the front lawn, late
in the afternoon of November 21, 1963, and you swung&mdash;you came to your
home, pulled up in your driveway as is your usual custom and parked your
car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had Lee Oswald noticed you then as you pulled in the driveway?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did he come over to your automobile?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you greet him in any fashion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My best recollection is I was already out of the automobile
when we actually exchanged greetings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did you express surprise that he was home that evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I did not express it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say anything indicating he knew he was there by surprise
or at least unexpectedly?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he do so at any time during the course of the evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She expressed surprise to me, yes; and apologized.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Apology for what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. For his having come without asking if he could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was your impression as to whether she was surprised?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My impression is she was surprised.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she say so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not specifically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she say she had not expected him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's the feeling I gathered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, from her facial expression, her mannerisms, her attitude&mdash;you
had the very definite impression that his arrival was unexpected as far as
she was concerned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As well as yours?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, as I recall your testimony, you entered the garage that
evening&mdash;you don't know how many times&mdash;you do have an icebox or deep
freeze in the garage, do you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It's a deep freeze.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is it not a fact that the deep freeze is located right up
against the wall separating the garage from the dining room portion of the
kitchen-dining room area, is that not correct, Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that deep freeze, John Joe, is what in length?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Three feet four inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And that length extends southwesterly from the garage dining
room wall toward Fifth Street; correct?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the deep freeze is how deep?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. It is two feet six inches deep.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the deepness extends from the door jam, west edge of the
door jam, westerly; is that correct?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Yes; to the wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And how high is the deep freeze?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. The deep freeze stands 3 feet 3 inches tall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Mrs. Paine, is that deep freeze the type of deep freeze
that you uncover from the top, that is, the lid opens?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is known as a chest style.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In preparing dinner, or even after dinner, your present recollection
is&mdash;since it is so much your habit&mdash;you can't remember the number
of times&mdash;it is your present recollection that in the ordinary course of attending
to your home and preparing a meal that evening you would enter the
garage at least going into some part of the deep freeze?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think it highly probable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you prepare the meal that evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you do anything else that evening in the garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I lacquered two large box blocks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you obtain, if you can, from the box of blocks which
I notice now in your living room, the two blocks you lacquered?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This is one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You say you lacquered two boxes or two blocks?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It's the same thing, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine has produced still another thing, and I take it,
Mrs. Paine, that you meant two boxes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I considered them blocks, but they do have the shape of a box.
They are what I call a large hollow block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They in turn are processed in building to be solid blocks?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's all right. I describe them as&mdash;they are sets&mdash;anything a
child wishes to make it into for play.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. One of them right now in your living room contains wooden
blocks, does it not?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the other is empty?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. John Joe, will you measure that which Mrs. Paine describes
as a block and which I describe as a box?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. It is 1/4-inch wide by 2 feet long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How deep?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. It is 7½ inches deep, with 1/2 inch press plywood on the
bottom, makes it a total height of 8 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. John Joe, is that which Mrs. Paine calls a block and I call a
box, rectangular&mdash;it has a bottom, or at least it has a plate on one side and
it is open on the top of it&mdash;the opposite side&mdash;is that not correct?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. It is open on the top, yes. It is closed on the five sides and
open on the top.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, just so we don't have any confusion in the record,
is my description of this as being a box a fair description?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I will adopt it for our usage, for usage here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are setting apart your sensitivity about blocks here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's quite all right&mdash;I will call it a box.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And those two boxes or containers, you lacquered these that
evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How long did that take you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. About half an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And where were you working?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was using the top of the deep freeze as a work space. I had
to walk from there to the work bench to get the lacquer and the brush.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which end of the work bench, the south or the north end?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The north end.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, what time of the evening, and I take it it was the evening,
am I correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, sir; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What time of the evening was it, approximately, when you
entered the garage to lacquer the two boxes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was 9 o'clock or a little bit after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were the two boxes inside your home, and did you take them
into the garage, or were they in the garage when you prepared to lacquer them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My best recollection is that one was in the house and one was
in the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, where was the one in the garage located when you went
into the garage to lacquer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was not on top of the deep freeze, was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; it's very likely it was in the central area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Somewhere near the blanket wrapped package?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Somewhat near the saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The circular saw or the band saw?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The circular saw, I think, but I don't recall specifically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, when you did open the garage, the entrance
to the <span class="locked">garage&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You mean the overhead door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No; the regular door into the garage.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh&mdash;that&mdash;yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Without offending you, Mrs. Paine, I assume that that door
to the garage is normally&mdash;you are careful to keep it closed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am, indeed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To the best of your recollection it was closed on this particular
occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You opened the door, did you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was the first thing that arrested your attention when
you opened the door, if anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was arrested by the fact that the light was on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The light where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The overhead light?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That headlight is approximately in the center of the ceiling
of the garage, is it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, I believe it is.</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. It may be slightly to the center.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is roughly to the center and the socket instrument looks like
a porcelain socket that extends out from the ceiling and hangs downwardly,
as a matter of fact, perpendicular to the floor or the ceiling; is that not right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That bulb that's in there now, Mrs. Paine, was that bulb in
place on the night in question?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the ceiling fixture is unshaded, is it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So, that, the bulb itself is bright and glaring?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. John Joe, would you take a look at that bulb and see what watt
it is?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. It is a 100-watt bulb, I just looked at it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it is quite bright, is it not?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Yes, sir; especially with the white reflection off of the white
walls.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, yes; this garage is painted white, is it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The garage door is a medium shade of grey, and when I say
"garage door" I mean the overhead door, which is now in place, the inside facing,
which I see from this doorway?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You noticed that the light was on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Why was that something that drew your attention?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I knew that I had not left it on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you had any habit in that respect?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It's my habit to turn the light off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And frugality, if not appearance, had dictated you in that
direction, had it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, more appearance than frugality.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And had Marina come to be aware of your habit? In that
direction, that is, of seeing that the light was off when you weren't using the
garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would suppose so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that your best present impression, Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I believe you testified that it was your opinion that at that time
that it had not been Marina who had left the light on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right&mdash;it was definitely not Marina at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But it was who&mdash;had left the light on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That Lee had left the light on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From that, you concluded that he had what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Been in the garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Prior to the time you entered the garage around 9 o'clock that
evening. Had it come to your attention in any manner or fashion that he had
been in the garage earlier in the evening, I mean, apart from this particular
circumstance you have now related?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know how long he had been out of it when I went in and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
found the light on. It is my impression he had been in it some time between
the dinner hour and the time I entered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, sitting as I am, in the dining room area of your kitchen&mdash;dining
room space&mdash;even if, as you have testified was the fact, that either you
alone or you and Marina were washing the dishes and cleaning up at least
after dinner, it would have been virtually impossible, wouldn't it, for anybody
to have entered the garage without your noticing it, that is, entering from the
kitchen-dining room area?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, would that not be especially true if you were in the dining
room portion of the kitchen-dining room area?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That would be unquestionably true&mdash;if you were in the kitchen-dining
area at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But you were not, I gather, at all times that evening up to
9 o'clock, in the kitchen-dining room area; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was in the kitchen-dining area part of the time, occasionally, I
would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were your children retired when you went into the garage, at
the time you went into the garage to lacquer your boxes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you put them to bed that evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, I had spent probably close to an hour in bed preparations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, during that period of time, Lee Oswald could have been
in your garage without your knowing it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think it's likely&mdash;it would have been likely that I would know
it then too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, how would you have known it if you were in that bedroom
which is in the northeast corner, which is as we have measured quite
a good distance from the entrance to the garage? How could you necessarily
have known it&mdash;that's the point I am making.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I could not necessarily have seen him enter. If I was fully in
the room, my going to bed activities include being in the bathroom, coming into
the kitchen, and going into the living room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Moving in and out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And I think I asked you during your testimony before the Commission&mdash;were
you conscious during the period up to 9 o'clock that evening that
Lee Oswald had been in the garage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is my&mdash;I recall the definite feeling that he had been in the
garage. I can't recall seeing him go in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, the police picked up some books, did they not, and other
papers and things of which you were not aware at the time, you weren't present
when they did that, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Most of what they took I did not see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I direct your attention to pages 144 to 147, inclusive, of a volume
which has a paster on its front cover reading, "Affidavits and statements taken
in connection with the assassination of the President," which I will state for
the record was furnished me by the Dallas police this afternoon. Pages 144
through 147 are headed, "Literature" as having been found by the Dallas police
either in the home of Mrs. Paine here in Irving, or in Lee Oswald's quarters
on Beckley Street in Dallas.</p>

<p>Would you please examine that list, Mrs. Paine, and you will notice each page
is headed "Name" and then the item is sought to be described, whether a letter,
a book, an application, a pamphlet or a booklet, as the case might be.</p>

<p>The second column is headed "place found" and underneath that appears
either the word "Irving" or the word "Beckley"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And there is a third column, headed "Microfilm," which indicates
that the police has microfilmed each item and they give the microfilm
number?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would you go through that list and arrest our attention to
any item which had come to your attention prior to November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. [Examining instruments referred to.] I do not think I see
anything that I had seen or have since seen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You have looked only on page 144.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I am sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Take that card there and go down that way with it so you don't
miss anything.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This is mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. The witness has now pointed at page 146 to what is
described as a magazine "Free World News." That's your own?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is a publication to which you subscribe?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; anyway, I receive it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And "Friends" mentioned there is what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There it refers to Quakers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The Quakers of your faith?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know whether that item is one I have seen or not, from
the description&mdash;it is microfilm 198.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You can't tell from the description whether that magazine, the
cover of which is described, is one you have seen around?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can't tell whether I've seen it or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't know whether it's yours or was not yours?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right&mdash;I can't tell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you examined those pages 144 through 147, inclusive?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the only item you found which is your property is the one
we have picked out&mdash;you have picked out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is it also your testimony that having examined all those
items which are listed as having been found by the police in your home in
Irving, that you don't recall having seen any of those in your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I'm quite certain I did not see&mdash;well, let's see, any of those with
the possible exception of a newspaper from Minsk.</p>

<p>"Magazine wrapper," I don't know whether that's it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, you can't tell from that description?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can't tell from that&mdash;perhaps there was no such listing, but
that's what I recall having seen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What do you recall having seen?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. A newspaper from Minsk, but it doesn't appear to be listed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes, it is&mdash;just a moment.</p>

<p>Let's go off the record here for a moment.</p>

<p>(Discussion between Counsel Jenner and the witness, Mrs. Paine, off the
record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I guess you are right&mdash;that was just a wrapper.</p>

<p>Now, I will ask that at this place in the deposition the reporter copy pages
144, 145, 146, and 147, to which we have been referring.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, Mrs. Paine, one of the things we said we might see is a
package that was in your garage containing curtain rods.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes&mdash;as you recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You said you would leave that package in precisely the place&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>wherever
it was last week when you were in Washington, D.C., and have you
touched it since you came home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have not touched it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is it now in the place it was to the best of your recollection
on November 21, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would you rise and enter the garage and point out in my
presence and in the presence of Mr. Howlett where that package is?</p>

<p>(At this point the persons heretofore mentioned entered the garage as stated
by Counsel Jenner.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is on a shelf above the workbench. It extends north of the
north edge of the workbench.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it the thicker of the two packages wrapped in brown wrapping
paper, shorter and thicker?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You would do well to look at them both.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, what I am going to do first&mdash;I'm going to hand you a
pointer, and would you point to the package that you have in mind?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This, to the best of my recollection, contains venetian blinds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The witness is now referring to a package which Mr. Howlett,
and I will ask you to measure it in a moment, but which appears to me to be
at most about 28 inches long, maybe 30, and about 6½ inches high and about
6½ inches through.</p>

<p>While it is still wrapped in place, Mr. Howlett, would you measure the
package and it is a little bit irregular.</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. That is 2 feet 11 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The package is 2 feet 11 inches long and it is resting on a shelf
which is apparently a foot down from the ceiling, and the north edge of the
package is 5 inches from the outer wall of the storeroom I have described, and
Mr. Howlett has now measured the distance from the shelf on which the
package is resting, to the floor, and that is what distance?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Seven feet and three inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, measure the height of the package.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. While you are up there, measure the one behind you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; we will.</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. The height of the package is about seven inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it is how thick through from east to west?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Seven inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. Now, I'll ask Mr. Howlett to take the package down,
since he is already up there on top of the bench, and we will open it in the
presence of Mrs. Paine and see what it contains.</p>

<p>The package has now been taken down from the shelf in our presence and
Mrs. Paine is opening it. Mrs. Paine, and in your presence, Mr. Howlett, what
does the package contain?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It contains two venetian blinds, both of them are 2 feet 6 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And they are of the metal variety, are they not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And those blinds are 2 feet 6 inches wide?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, they are wrapped in brown or light-tan wrapping paper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have a supply of this particular wrapping paper around
your home at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From where did you obtain this wrapping paper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This must have come around a package or something I had
bought. I have never had a supply of this variety.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, John Joe, will you favor Mrs. Paine by putting her package
back the way it was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes&mdash;for the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For the record, when we sought to rewrap the package, it has
a paster on the outside of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., Dallas, No. 4017, and "Will
call&mdash;M.&nbsp;R. Paine."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
Mrs. Paine has torn from the package some sticky tape.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is wider than the variety we have heretofore identified&mdash;is it
your recollection that this sticky tape came on this particular package when it
was delivered to your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is this paper the paper in which the blinds came in the first
instance?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. These blinds did not come to me from Sears, Roebuck, but that&mdash;I
used to replace them did. Now, whether the shades I bought came in this
package, I have no idea whatever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, is it your recollection that this paper in which the blinds
are now wrapped came from another package that was delivered to you and
not a part of a general supply of paper which you had in your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was certainly not part of a general supply of paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it your recollection that the sticky tape that appears on this
wrapping was affixed to the package which this is?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. As you said, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This paper&mdash;when delivered to your home, having nothing to
do with the curtain rods or the rifle or anything else hereon, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, we see in back of this package that we have just described
a much longer package also wrapped on&mdash;in light-tan wrapping paper&mdash;at this
time a little bit darker, I think, than the package we have just been describing,
and Mr. Howlett has now mounted again the work bench and is measuring that
package. That package, Mr. Howlett, is also on the shelf.</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. The same shelf in behind where the other package was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it is how long?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Three feet nine inches long, as it is folded now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And in general is it a rectangular package?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But its shape is not as well defined as the shorter package we
have already described?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. No, sir; it seems to be a little bit bigger at the north end.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, before we open it, what is in that package?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My best guess would be that it contains two pull blinds which I
did have in the southeast bedroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you say "pull blinds" you mean venetian blinds?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I do not. I mean roll-type.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Howlett, would you be good enough to take that package
down and we will open it in Mrs Paine's presence here.</p>

<p>(At this point Agent Howlett complied with the request of Counsel Jenner.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It contains, does it not, what you call the pull blinds, and which
I, in my vernacular call spring window shades.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All, right, that's correct, and these are cut to fit the windows in
the southeast bedroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Howlett, there are two of them, one of which is how wide?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Two feet six inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the other one is?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Three feet six inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And Mr. Howlett and Mrs. Paine, these two spring window-shades
are the customary type we see on windows, these, however, are white
or cream colored, and are plastic?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And they are opaque?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Neither is metal?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The spring to which the shade itself&mdash;the plastic shade is attached,
is wood, inside of which there is the usual window shade spring.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The paper in which these are wrapped likewise contains as did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
the other one an address sticker of Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., No. 4017, addressed
to Michael R. Paine.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And so, the wrapping paper in which those two shades are wrapped
came from Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. and not from any roll of paper that you
keep in your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, are there any other paper-wrapped packages on that shelf?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It was your impression as you testified last week that you had
some curtain rods on the shelf wrapped in a paper wrapping?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I testified that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was your impression, was it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And as part of the testimony I said they were very light and
might not deserve their own wrapping.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You, of course&mdash;you did state it was possible they might not
be separately wrapped?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there another shelf below the shelf on which you found the
first two packages?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; there is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, Mr. Howlett, that shelf is about how far below the upper
one on which we found the two packages?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. About 10½ inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, we all see, do we not, peeking up what appears to be a
butt end of what we might call a curtain rod, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that correct, Mr. Howlett?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Yes, sir; that's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Painted or enameled white?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you reach back there and take out what appears to be a
curtain rod, Mr. Howlett&mdash;how many do you have there?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. There are two curtain rods, one a white and the other a
kind of buff color or cream colored.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would you please search the rest of that shelf and see if
you can find any other curtain rods or anything similar to the curtain rods, and
look on the bottom shelves, Mr. Howlett, will you please?</p>

<p>While he is doing that, Mrs. Paine, I notice there is on your garage floor
what looks like a file casing you have for documents similar, at least it seems
substantially identical to those that we had in Washington last week.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This is a filing case similar, yes, slightly different in color to one
that you had in Washington. It contains madrigal music. It was on November
22 at the apartment where my husband was living.</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. I have just finished searching both shelves and I don't find
any other curtain rods.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, are the curtain rods that Mr. Howlett has taken
down from the lower of the two shelves, the two curtain rods to which you made
reference in your testimony before the Commission last week?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; they are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you know of no other curtain rods, do you, in your garage
during the fall of 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And in particular, no other curtain rods in your garage at any
time on the 21st or 22d of November 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. None whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May we take these curtain rods and mark them as exhibits and
we will return them after they have been placed of record?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Miss Reporter, the cream colored curtain rod, we will mark Ruth
Paine Exhibit 275 and the white one as Ruth Paine Exhibit No. 276.</p>

<p>(The curtain rods referred to were at this time marked by the reporter as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
Ruth Paine Exhibit Nos. 275 and 276, for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Since we will have the exact physical exhibits we don't have to
measure them, but perhaps for somebody who is reading the record, Mr. Howlett,
your suggestion that we measure them is not a bad one. Let me describe
the configuration of these rods. They are very light weight&mdash;what would you
say that metal is, Mr. Howlett, tin&mdash;heavy tin?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They are the sliding or extension type, one fitting into the other
when closed entirely, measuring from upended tip to upended tip they <span class="locked">are&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. The white one is 2 feet 3½ inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the cream colored one measured in the like fashion?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. It is 2 feet 3½ inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. These curtain rods&mdash;the ends of each of them are turned. Those
ends extending are turned up how many inches?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. About 2 inches measuring from the inside of the curtain rod.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the cream colored one, and what about the white one?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Yes; on the cream colored one and the white one measures
about 2-3/8 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, these curtain rods with the ends turned up form a "U," do
they not, a long "U"?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, Mrs. Paine, we have only remaining the one other item to
which you have called our attention and that is the correspondence between you
and Marina Oswald subsequent to November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you been able to assemble that correspondence for me?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I appear only to have the translation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I beg your pardon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I appear only to have the translation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You appear only to have the translation&mdash;will you explain that
remark?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The correspondence you refer to is all by me, with the exception
of one Christmas card from Marina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When it is by you, you mean it is correspondence you transmitted
to her and therefore you do not have the originals?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I thought I had the rough draft of what I wrote&mdash;I appear only
to have a translation of that rough draft. I made a translation for several of
these&mdash;I made a translation at the time and sent them off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At the time you prepared the originals?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May I have the translations?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; you may.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="jjh">TESTIMONY OF AGENT JOHN JOE HOWLETT</h2>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. While we are doing that, Miss Oliver, since I have involved
Agent Howlett in this deposition&mdash;Mr. Howlett, would you rise and be sworn
and I will ask you some questions in connection with this deposition, and in
that regard do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p class="p2">Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. State your name, please?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. John Joe Howlett.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you are a member of the Secret Service of the United States?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Yes, sir; special agent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In the Dallas office?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you accompanied Miss Oliver and myself this evening,
brought us out to Mrs. Paine's home?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have been present throughout my examination of Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
Paine and my examination of the premises, and you have assisted me, have you
not?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In making measurements and also in recounting the appearance
of rooms, front lawn, garage, and otherwise?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In all those measurements that you made and reported to the
reporter, were they as accurately made as you could make them under the
conditions?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you report, orally, truthfully, and accurately the various
measurements that are now recorded in this record?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And were you present during the time that I also called figures
or ordered descriptions?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And were the figures I called and the descriptions I made, to the
best of your knowledge, information and belief, accurate?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And made in your presence?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. There is one thing on there&mdash;on the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which window?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. The window in the southeast bedroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes&mdash;that's Marina's bedroom, is it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She was staying in there&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. I believe I previously reported that as 3 feet 3 inches, and
I think it should have been 3 feet 8 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. High or wide?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. Wide&mdash;would you like for me to check it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; you might check it.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It's probably 3 feet 6 inches&mdash;it's identical to the shade we have
just measured.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion between Counsel Jenner, Agent Howlett, and the witness, Mrs.
Paine.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Back on the record for Mrs. Paine's testimony.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="rhp2">TESTIMONY OF RUTH HYDE PAINE RESUMED</h2>

<p>Mrs. Paine has now produced and has in front of her as she is seated here at
the table, some documents&mdash;what are they, Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have here translations of seven of the letters, and they are
the seven most recent letters that I have sent to Marina Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Since November 22?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Since November 22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. They consist of one, two, three, four, five, six, seven pages?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Each letter is complete on one page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And I will now mark that seven-page document as "Ruth Paine
Exhibit No. 277."</p>

<p>(Instrument marked by the reporter as "Ruth Paine Exhibit No. 277," for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And, I would like to describe what little correspondence between
November 22 and the first date here&mdash;December 27.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you forgive me if I asked you a few more questions
about the exhibit first?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, yes; I'm sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. "Ruth Paine Exhibit 277" consists of seven pages of translations
prepared by you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of the letters that you prepared, the originals of which you
transmitted or delivered?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You transmitted by mail or delivered by hand or some other
fashion to Marina?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or sought to have delivered to her&mdash;should I put it that way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And do you note throughout this material the means or method
by which you sought to draw these letters to her attention?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Each one says how it was sent&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And when did you make the transcripts that now appear as Ruth
Paine Exhibit 277, by transcript I mean translations.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes&mdash;the first three letters here, I have a note at the top indicating
when the translation was made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When were they made with relation to when the originals were
dispatched?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The first three translations were made later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How much later?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, depending&mdash;the translations were all made on January 26.
The first three letters were written respectively, December 27, December 28
and January 3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And from what did you make the translation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. From my notes in Russian of the original letter which I cannot
now find.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You prepared a first draft and then after you had prepared the
first draft and gone over it to make sure it recited what you wished, you then
wrote the final answer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right&mdash;in Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In Russian and dispatched it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And they are pages 4 through 7, correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right&mdash;the other translations were all made at the time
indicated on the page, which was also the time the letter was written and sent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, have you in the last day or two at my request reviewed
carefully the translations which now compose this Ruth Paine Exhibit 277?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And to the best of your knowledge, information and belief, after
that check are you now able to say whether those transcriptions are accurate
and whether also the statements you make of descriptive character in connection
therewith are also accurate and truthful?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I believe them to be fully accurate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you had another sheaf of papers when you produced
Exhibit 277&mdash;what are those papers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have a few scratch notes which tell what correspondence there
was between November 22 and the first date of this exhibit, which was
December 27.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Refreshing your recollection from those notes, tell me if you
can what correspondence there was prior to the first letter, which appears
as December 27, in Ruth Paine Exhibit 277?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There were two or three short notes written by myself to Marina
Oswald and sent to her along with a small stack of letters and checks which
had come addressed to me, but really for her. I sent these via the Irving
Police to Secret Service. I have no copies of these, but I have seen one in
translation, I believe it to have been the second one that I wrote, among the
Commission papers that were shown to me in Washington.</p>

<p>There was a note and Christmas card sent to me by Marina and postmarked
December 21. Then, there was also a note and Christmas card sent by me
to Marina on the same date, December 21.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you send that before or after you received her card?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They crossed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you able to translate now for the record the wording of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
the Christmas card or message received from Marina by you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would rather have a few minutes with it before doing it for
the record. I have not done it in advance because time didn't serve. I do
want here to try to describe what I recall as the content of my note, which
I have no copy of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Notes that are in your hand, are they in Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. These, no; this is descriptive of what I sent and the situation
surrounding the note I sent to her on December 21, and as I say, I have no copy
of that note. I included a Christmas greeting from myself and my children and
expressed my concern for her and said I didn't want to bother her, but I did
want to see her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To the extent you can recite it literally, do so, please.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can't&mdash;I handed this note to Mr. Martin in his home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is this the note you had in mind when you testified last week before
the Commission that you had gone to his home and delivered something to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Along with some other letters that had come containing contributions
from kindhearted Americans which had been sent to Marina and
arrived at your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right. I talked with Mr. Martin and after having talked
with him I added something to my note, saying that I had talked with him and
that it had relieved my mind somewhat about her. I also brought that same day
an opened package containing wrapped Christmas gifts which had come to my
home addressed to me from a lady who had previously written to inquire what
kind of gifts might be appropriate for Marina's children. When I opened the
package, though the outside had been addressed to me, the inside was labeled,
"Rachel" and "Junie", and clearly Christmas gifts for Marina and the two
children. I also brought a small box of Christmas cookies for the Martin family.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As gifts from you and your children to the Martin family?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right; that's correct.</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. I remeasured that window at the southeast corner of the
house&mdash;the first bedroom&mdash;the one which Marina was in, and that picture window
is correctly 3 feet 7 inches wide.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, we will go off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion between Counsel Jenner and the witness, Mrs. Paine, off the
record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Back on the record.</p>

<p>Mrs. Paine, you recall that last week in testifying before the Commission,
you referred to an incident in which you drove into Dallas with Lee Oswald
accompanying you, for the purpose of having a key on your typewriter repaired?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what date was that that you drove into Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My recollection is that we drove in on October 14, Monday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Have you, since your return to Irving from Washington, found
something in your home that helps refresh your recollection about that incident?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I looked up the check stubs to see what date I wrote the Weaver
Office Machines Co. a check to pay for that typewriter key repair. The check
was written when we went to pick up the machine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you said "we." Did Lee Oswald accompany you on that
occasion as well?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, he did not; just Marina and myself and our children went in,
and the check stub is dated October 18.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And does that refresh your recollection as to the date when
you picked up the typewriter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is, of course, the date I picked up the typewriter, and it is
my best judgment that it was therefore the preceding Monday that I took the
typewriter in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And what was the occasion again to&mdash;why you had the typewriter
repaired as of that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The original key was incorrect&mdash;I had it replaced.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Incorrect in what sense&mdash;it had an incorrect Russian symbol&mdash;Russian
language symbol?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you wanted to replace it for what reason&mdash;did Lee Oswald
desire to use it or were you using it or what were the circumstances?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was using the typewriter in preparation for teaching Russian to
one student.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there anything else about that incident that you would like to
add to the record.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, Mrs. Paine, I can think of no additional questions at the
moment.</p>

<p>Is there anything that has occurred to you in the meantime that is, since you
were in Washington, to which you would like to draw my attention and the
attention of the Commission as possibly having a bearing on the Commission's
investigation, the nature of which you have been heretofore advised?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. There is nothing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This is rather an aside, I would think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, let's go off the record a minute.</p>

<p>(Discussion between Counsel Jenner and the witness, Mrs. Paine, off the
record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We go back on the record.</p>

<p>In gifts received by you since November 22, 1963, at your home, that is, gifts
to Marina, did some of those gifts come in the form of cash as distinguished
from check or money orders?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, some of them did. I regret that most of those that came as
cash came early and I simply sent them on to Secret Service as cash. After&mdash;about
the end of 1963 I began to wonder, since I had not heard directly from
Marina, whether she was getting these, and I therefore decided to send any
such contributions that came to me as cash on to her as checks drawn on my
bank account.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Had you talked with John Thorne, or Jim Martin in advance
of delivering those checks&mdash;"yes" or "no"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right, tell us the circumstances?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I asked John <span class="locked">Thorne&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. By telephone or direct inquiry face to face?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In person, at his office, whether Marina Oswald was signing,
and by this I meant&mdash;endorsing her own checks and his reply to me was that
everything she can do herself she is doing. From this I assumed she could
sign her name. I left a letter which enclosed such a check written by me
to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You left with whom? With John Thorne or with Mr. Martin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It does look as if I had left it&mdash;let's see&mdash;given to the hand of
John Thorne.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Excuse me, you have now turned to the second page of Ruth
Paine Exhibit 277 and you are pointing to a footnote at the bottom of that
page, are you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the reference there to this letter is to the letter which appears
on that page?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And do I take it from the footnote that accompanying that
letter transcribed in the second page of Ruth Paine Exhibit 277, accompanying
it was a check?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right, enclosed in the stamped and sealed envelope.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And the check is the instrument you now hand me, dated December
28, 1963, check number 205 in the sum of $10, payable to Marina Oswald,
which we will mark as Ruth Paine Exhibit 277-A.</p>

<p>(Exhibit marked by the reporter as Ruth Paine Exhibit No. 277-A, for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the reverse side of that there appears in longhand as an
endorsement and the name "Marina Oswald." Do you see it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you familiar with that signature?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Are you familiar with Marina Oswald's signature?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Looking at the endorsement on the reverse side of Exhibit 277-A,
in your opinion is or is not that Marina Oswald's signature?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is not Marina Oswald's official hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you repeat that process on some subsequent occasions of
remitting cash gifts by check?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have now handed me another instrument which purports
to be and which is a check.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the Southwest Bank and Trust Co., and what is the other
document No. 277-A, this one, which is dated January 8, 1964, and it is the
sum of $5 and it is check No. 216.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is also payable to Marina Oswald; is that your check?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We will mark it as Ruth Paine Exhibit No. 277-B.</p>

<p>(Instrument referred to marked by the reporter as Ruth Paine Exhibit No.
277-B, for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Referring to Exhibit 277-A and 277-B, does your signature
appears as the maker of each of those checks?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you recall distinctly that you did make them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And these are the cancelled checks that are returned to you by
your bank, Southwest Bank &amp; Trust Co.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Referring to Exhibit No. 277-A and turning it over, is there
an endorsement on the reverse side?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; there is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And do you recognize that endorsement?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is it in longhand?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In whose hand?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is in Marina Oswald's hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And it reads "Marina Oswald," does it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Each of these checks also bears the stamped endorsement "For
deposit only, to Oswald Trust Fund," is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right&mdash;that should be said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And are these instruments now in the same condition when
they were returned to you, by your bank?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; they are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Miss Reporter, I hand you the check No. 205 dated December 28,
1963, please mark it Ruth Paine Exhibit No. 277-A. And mark check No. 216,
dated January 8, 1964, as Ruth Paine Exhibit No. 277-B.</p>

<p>(Instruments marked by the reporter as Ruth Paine Exhibits Nos. 277-A and
277-B.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. May I have your permission, please Mrs. Paine, to retain these
two exhibits and as soon as I have photostated them with all of the other
originals of documents that you produced last week, I want to return them all
to you at once.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Anything else, now, that occurs to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Anything else that is pertinent which you think might be helpful
to the Commission in this investigation?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We have been on and off the record during the course of this
session, Mrs. Paine, in which I have had some conversation with you. Is there
anything that occurred during those off-the-record sessions which you regard
as pertinent which I have not brought out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is there anything that occurred in those off-the-record sessions
which in your opinion is inconsistent with anything that has been stated and
testified in the record by you or stated into the record by Mr. Howlett or by me?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion between Counsel Jenner and the witness, Mrs. Paine, off the
record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Back on the record now, please. Facing north, in the rear
of the Paine home, the rear door leading from the kitchen-dining room area out
onto the yard in the rear, there is a large pleasant, completely open yard with
grass. The plot is surrounded by a cyclone fence 5 feet high with a gate so that
children playing, small children playing in the yard are completely protected
and prevented from getting out. That yard area, measuring from the north
wall of the home to the rear fence is 80 feet, 6 inches and in width, measuring
east to west, the yard from cyclone fence to cyclone fence is 51 feet. There
is a clothesline that traverses from east to west in the yard and the clothesline
itself, the poles, which are parallel to the east-west line of the house and east-west
fence in the rear is 19½ feet south of the rear fence. There are two large
shade trees, both oaks, the one at the easterly line near the easterly fence is
7 feet, 9 inches in circumference. There is one almost opposite on the west,
which is much smaller, and is about&mdash;not quite a foot thick.</p>

<p>The tree in the front of the house which we have described earlier has a
circumference of 6 feet, 3 inches, and the circumferences we have recited in the
record were measured at 3 feet from the ground.</p>

<p>Is that correct, Mr. Howlett?</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. It is 6 feet on the tree in the front, 3 feet from the ground.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see&mdash;I recited it 3 inches and that was in error.</p>

<p>Agent <span class="smcap">Howlett</span>. It should be 6 feet, measured 3 feet from the ground.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, have you translated the note which appears on the
inside of the Christmas card from Marina, about which you have testified this
evening?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It appears on the left inside portion, does it not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Of the Christmas card and having interpreted or translated it
would you read the translation into the record?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The translation says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Ruth</span>:</p>

<p>Sends here greetings to you, Micheal and the children and wishes for a Merry
Christmas and Happy New Year. I am very sorry that our friendship ended
so unfortunately but it was not my fault. I hope that the new year will bring
us all better changes. I wish you health, fortune, happiness and all of the
very best. A great big thank you for all the fine things you did for me.</p>

<p class="in2">Sincerely,</p>

<div class="sig-container"><div class="sig-block"><div class="sig">
<span class="smcap">Marina</span>.
</div></div></div>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Write if you feel like it, please. Greetings from little June. I kiss
you, Marina."</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you, Mrs. Paine.</p>

<p>Now, you have handed me a Christmas card, the cover page of which reads,
"Wishing you the best," and there is an insignia on the front of it. I have
already referred to the inside cover page, which you now have interpreted for
us, and directing your attention to that writing which appears to be in red
ink, are you familiar with the writing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I am.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whose writing is it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is Marina Oswald's writing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You also handed me an envelope which is postmarked at Dallas
on December 21, 1963, and there appears to be some handwriting on that. Are
you familiar with that handwriting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whose is that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is Marina Oswald's handwriting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Here again as in the case of other envelopes, the envelope itself&mdash;everything
appearing on the face of the envelope is in English?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Whereas, the note on the inside is in Russian?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this is as you testified&mdash;she was able to write English to
the extent of addressing letters, cards, and envelopes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Miss Reporter, would you now mark the two exhibits I now
hand you as Ruth Paine Exhibit Nos. 278, the card, and 278-A, the envelope?</p>

<p>(Instruments referred to marked by the reporter as Ruth Paine Exhibit Nos.
278 and 278-A, for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, is the card in the same condition now as it was
except for the reporter's identification, when you received it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was Ruth Paine Exhibit 278, the card enclosed in the
envelope which has been identified as Ruth Paine Exhibit No. 278-A?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; it was so enclosed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And except for having slit the envelope to remove its contents,
is the envelope in the same condition now as it was when you received it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And may we, as in the case of the other exhibits, retain the
original and when I have photostated it we will return them to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I offer in evidence all of the exhibits which have been identified
this evening.</p>

<p>Is there anything at all which has occurred to you that you desire to add,
Mrs. Paine?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can think of nothing else at this point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I do want to ask you this&mdash;while you were translating the Christmas
card message, Mr. Howlett and I measured&mdash;we went out in your back
yard area, which is large and open, and we measured it and I recited the measurements
in the record and the location of your large beautiful shade trees. I
noted that there traverses from east to west your yard in the rear a clothesline.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And I measured that as being located at 19½ feet south of the
back porch&mdash;of the back fence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that the clothesline to which you made reference when you
testified last week in Washington as to where Marina was on the midafternoon
or early afternoon of November 22 when you went out to advise her that you
had heard over the radio the name "Lee Oswald" in connection with events
that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; it was not that that I heard. I heard that a shot had been
fired from the School Book Depository Building and this is what I told her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is that clothesline and those posts which support the clothesline
and from which the line is stretched across the yard in the same position
now as those posts were on that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; they are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can't remember whether as part of my testimony describing
the evening of November 22, I said that Marina told me that when I reported
to her the situation at the clothesline that the TV had announced that the
shots which hit the President were fired from the School Book Depository.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
She recalled that to me in the evening and told me when I had told her this,
her heart went to the bottom. I don't recall whether I included that, but I
remember that during the Commission hearings&mdash;I have recalled it since.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I direct your attention to page 49 of the document entitled "Affidavits
and Statements Taken in Connection With the Assassination of the President,"
to which we have heretofore made reference when I asked you to examine
a list of documents and books and records and papers and pamphlets. Directing
your attention to page 49&mdash;is that an affidavit or a signed statement that you
furnished the Dallas city police?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And is that the statement to which you had reference in your
testimony before the Commission that you gave on the evening of November 22?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The 22d, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Under examination by an officer of the Dallas city police?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Will you read it through and see if it serves to refresh your
recollection, read it to yourself, and see if it serves to refresh your recollection
as to anything you might not have included in your testimony last week as to
what occurred during the course of the interview of the Dallas city police
with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall most of that content but that surely was it&mdash;I was
under a good deal of stress at the time.</p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Before Me</span>, Patsy Collins, a Notary Public in and for said county, State of
Texas, on this day personally appeared Ruth Hyde Paine/w/f/31, 2515 W. Fifth
Street, Irving, Texas. Who, after being by me duly sworn, on oath deposes and
says: I have lived at the above address for about 4 years. My husband, Michael
and I had been separated for about a year. IN the early winter of 1963, I went
to a party in Dallas because I heard that some people would be there that spoke
Russian. I was interested in the language. At that party I met Lee Oswald
and his Russian wife Marina. About a month later I went to visit them on
Neely Street. In May I asked her to stay with me because Lee went to New
Orleans to look for work. About two weeks later I took Marina to New Orleans
to join her husband. Around the end of September I stopped by to see them
while I was on vacation. I brought Marina back with me to Irving. He came
in 2 weeks, later, but did not stay with his wife and me. Marina's husband
would come and spend most of the weekends with his wife. Through my neighbor,
we heard there was an opening at the Texas School Book Depository. Lee
applied and was accepted. Lee did not spend last weekend there. He came
in about 5 pm yesterday and spent the night. I was asleep this morning when
he left for work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I direct your attention to page 46. There appears to be
a signature of Mrs. Marina Oswald on that page. You are familiar with her
signature?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Is that her signature?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, that is her signature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Will you read the statement and see if it serves to refresh your
recollection or stimulate some other recollection as to what occurred that evening
or at any other time, to which you have not already testified.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. (Read instrument referred to.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, you have now read what purports to be a statement
taken from Marina Oswald on the night of November 22 at the Dallas City
Police Station?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On that occasion did you interpret or translate for Marina
Oswald?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were you present when she was examined?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And now, having examined the statement transcribed on page 46,
to the best of your recollection, to the extent it summarizes what was said, is it
accurate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I particularly remember the part of the testimony or the
statement, sworn statement, that talks about the rifle, that she had known there
had been a rifle in the garage and that it was not there on the 22d, that she could
not positively say it was her husband's rifle when they showed her a rifle at the
police station. This is what I particularly remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall that she fixed the time when she had seen the
blanket prior to November 22 as having been 2 weeks prior thereto?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She was indefinite, more so than the statement here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The statement reads, "I opened the blanket and saw a rifle in it."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My recollection of that is that she opened the blanket and saw
a portion of what she judged to be a rifle, having known already that her husband
had one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did she identify the part she saw as the stock of the rifle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't recall&mdash;that was all done by the police.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mrs. Paine, is there anything in addition that has occurred to
you&mdash;however, Mr. Howlett has called my attention to something we thought
we might ask you before we close.</p>

<p>Directing your attention to the bottom drawer of the secretary in the kitchen-dining
area of the house, was Lee Oswald familiar with the contents of that
drawer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think it appears in my testimony at Washington that to the best
of my knowledge neither he nor Marina saw me use the contents of that drawer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you ever see either of them enter that drawer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right. I think I am finished&mdash;is there anything you wish to
add?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is now 10 minutes after 11 and we arrived here at 7:30 this
evening. Mrs. Paine, again I express to you my personal appreciation of the
length to which you have gone to be cooperative with me and with the Commission
and with all of us undertaking this sometimes gruesome work.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I am glad to help.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you have been very helpful. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This deposition will be transcribed. We will have it here in
Dallas next week when I return. If you wish to read it, you may do so and you
may call me at the United States attorney's office and it will be available to you
to read. If the other transcript is ready, since I am officially authorized to have
the same in my possession, I will do my best to bring one with me so that you
may read your testimony of last week as well.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would be very interested in that, thank you, and I could then
sign this deposition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; you could sign this and the deposition I took of you on
Saturday of last week.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All right. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Thank you again, and that is all.</p>

<h2 id="mrp">TESTIMONY OF MICHAEL R. PAINE</h2>

<p>The testimony of Michael R. Paine was taken at 2:30 p.m., on March 17, 1964,
at 200 Maryland Avenue NE., Washington, D.C., by Messrs. Wesley J. Liebeler
and Norman Redlich, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span></p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. We have asked you to come here so we can take your deposition
to find out some of the background information that you have about Lee
Harvey Oswald as a result of your knowing him throughout part of 1963, up
to the time of the assassination.</p>

<p>We particularly want to ask you this afternoon about your knowledge of the
possible possession by Lee Harvey Oswald of the weapon that was allegedly used
to assassinate the President, or of any other weapon at the time while he had
some of his effects stored as we understand it in your garage in Texas.</p>

<p>I also want to inquire of you this afternoon concerning your knowledge of
Lee Oswald's financial affairs, whether you have lent him any money or whether
he ever, he or his wife ever, obtained any money through you or your wife,
and we will also ask you about other matters relating to the general subject of
the assassination and the subsequent death of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>I want to go first, Mr. Paine, to the period September of 1963, but before I
do that, will you state your name for the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Michael Paine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is your address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. 2515 West Fifth, Irving, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. By whom are you employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Bell Helicopter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where are they located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Fort Worth, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever make the acquaintance of Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us briefly the circumstances under which that
occurred?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My wife invited Lee and his wife over to supper one evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Will you tell us approximately when that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think it was in April.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I have depended upon my wife for all the dates. She has
kept a calendar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you discuss with your wife the, after the assassination the,
approximate time when you first met the Oswalds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, yes, we did. Or at least she had to report that to other
people and I was listening in but I have forgotten the dates.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did your wife meet the Oswalds at the same time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; she met them at a party that was held at a friend's house and
we were invited to, both of us were invited to, go meet this couple who were
represented as he having been an American who had defected to Russia, and
came back with a Russian wife. I think I was sick or something and for some
reason I couldn't go so I didn't meet him at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell us approximately when that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It would be much more sensible to get all the exact dates from
my wife but I think that was in February.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, after you first met Oswald, and we will go into the conversation
that you had with him when you met him and after that more in
detail to him before the Commission, when was the next time that you met him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't think I met him again until he joined Marina at our house
in September or the beginning of October, I guess it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us briefly the circumstances surrounding the
second meeting with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, Ruth had invited Marina to come and have her baby early
in the summer when she knew that she was pregnant, to come have her baby,
if she wished, at our house, where she would have the help of another woman
who could speak Russian. Ruth stopped by from her visit on the east coast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
stopped on her way back to Texas, stopped in New Orleans to see them, and
found that Lee was out of work again, and picked up Marina at that time and
brought her back to Dallas which was the end of September, and Marina then
and her child stayed there and had another child, and stayed there until the
assassination. And about a week later Marina was there for about a week
before Lee called up, and I guess Lee came out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you there when he came out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't remember. I would come normally, I was not living at the
house at the time, and I would normally appear on, regularly on, Fridays, and
generally some other day in the week, I think it was a Wednesday, Tuesday or
Wednesday, for supper.</p>

<p>So I would have seen him if it was a Friday but I don't happen to recall the
particular occasion. I think perhaps I wasn't there because I recall Ruth telling
me how glad Marina was to see him or hear his voice on the telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You and your wife were separated at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell us approximately when you were first separated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, we have been living apart about a year, I suppose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At that time, you mean in October?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It had been a year; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So it would have been in October of 1962?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I guess it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you living in Grand Prairie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How often would you visit your wife during the period that
you were separated particularly during the period of September-October?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, as I say it was 2 nights a week, 2 evenings a week was a
regular thing, and I would frequently come around weekends. The garage
had been my shop, with my tools that I occasionally used and I would stop
by on weekends, on Sunday anyways, Friday for sure, Sunday accidentally, and
generally, I think, on a Tuesday or Wednesday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you came to the house did you stay there overnight or did
you just <span class="locked">come&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I would just stay for supper in the evening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you were residing entirely, spending your evenings in your
own apartment in Grand Prairie during this period of time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you recall that your wife went on a trip to the eastern part
of the United States in the fall of 1963, summer-fall of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was mostly the summer. She went about July and she spent a
couple of months, the end of July, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know approximately when she got back to Irving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I think she came by around September 24 is the date, I don't
remember whether that was the date she arrived in New Orleans or the date
she arrived at Irving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, after she did return to Irving, and as you said brought
Marina and the child with her, do you recall whether she also brought Oswald's
personal and household effects?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I do remember she asked me to unpack or take some of the
heavy things out of the car. I think that was only dufflebags but whatever
it was it was so easy, I didn't really notice what it was to take out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That was shortly after she returned from her trip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That would suggest either the same day or the next day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was thinking it would be much better to get, if it is important
at all, to, she probably remembers these dates exactly and we could judge that
I would be there. It happened the 24th was a Friday. If that was the date she
got back, then I would know that I arrived the date they came back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, did you ever have occasion to go into the garage toward
the end of September after your wife had returned for any reason?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. As I say that was, I still had a number of things there, and
the tools were there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you used the tools from time to time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. During the time that you used the tools, did you ever see a
package wrapped in a blanket lying in the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; that is one of the clearest things in my mind. I had had to
move that. The garage is rather crowded especially with their things in it. It
had degenerated from a shop into a storage place and in order to use the tools
at all I would have to move things out of the way, and one of the packages was
this blanket wrapped with a string and I had had to move it several times. I
knew it belonged to the Oswalds. I am polite so I don't look into a package or
even I wouldn't look into a letter if it were in an envelope which was unsealed.
But I picked up this package and the first time I picked it up I thought it was
a camping equipment and thought to myself they don't make camping equipment
of iron any more, and at another time I think I picked it up at least twice
or three times, and one time I had to put it on the floor, and there was a&mdash;I was
a little ashamed because I didn't know what I was putting on the floor and I was
going to get it covered with sawdust but I again supposed that it was camping
equipment that wouldn't be injured by it being on the floor. I supposed it was
camping equipment because it was wrapped in this greenish rustic blanket and
that was the reason I thought it was a rustic thing.</p>

<p>I had also going a little further thought what kind of camping equipment has
something this way and one going off 45°, a short stub like that. Then there
was also a certain wideness at one end and then I thought of a folding tool I
had in the Army, a folding shovel and I was trying to think how a folding shovel
fit with the rest of this because that wasn't quite, the folding shovel was too
symmetrical. That was as far as my thinking went on the subject but at one
time or another those various thoughts would occur before I got to using the tools
myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever think there were tent poles in the package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I supposed they were tent poles. I first thought it was tent
poles and then I thought there are not enough poles here, enough to make a tent.
I didn't think very elaborately about it but just kind of in the back of my mind
before I got on to the next thing I visualized a pipe or possibly two, and with
something coming off, that must come off kind of abruptly a few inches at 45°
angle. I can draw you a picture of the thing as I had it. You know I wasn't
thinking of a rifle. Definitely that thought never occurred to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you draw us a picture for it and I hand you a yellow pad
and let me get you a pen. Would you draw a picture for us of what you
visualized to be in the package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Also this was&mdash;I visualized after I put the package down. I would
lift the package up, move it, put the package down and one time I was trying to
puzzle how you could make camping equipment out of something&mdash;this is only
one pipe in the package. That is the only thing. Then a little shovel which I
am speaking is an Army shovel which looks something like so, and it has a folding
handle on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you have drawn on this piece of paper two different pictures,
one of which you indicate as the shovel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was trying to put these in the package to make something that
I thought was a pipe about 30 inches long. Of course, that actual package as
I visualized it&mdash;that is the outline, that is how it lay in the package.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have drawn a dotted line, outline around his first picture
that you drew which you indicated you thought you conceived of as an iron
pipe of some sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you mark this. I hand this to the reporter and ask him
to mark this as Exhibit 1.</p>

<p>(The drawing was marked "Michael Paine Exhibit No. 1".)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you moved this package around, did it appear to you
that there was more than one object inside of it or did it appear to be a solid
piece or just what was your feeling?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I didn't think. It remained in the package&mdash;nothing jelled. I
think I thought about it more than once because my thoughts didn't hold together
enough.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did it rattle at all when you moved it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; it didn't rattle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I kind of rejected the shovel idea because that was not, that was
too symmetrical.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was too symmetrical?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The shovel the shaft and the blade of the shovel are symmetrical,
the shaft is on the center line of the shovel and here this wider area had to
be offset somehow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You said you thought it was about 30 inches long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I am just telling you. I picked up a package which I first
thought camping equipment, heavy iron pipes, and then I tried, then later, maybe
when I had left, I tried to think, well, what kind of camping equipment has
that little stub on it that goes off at an angle or asymmetric like that, and
the flat end down there and I tried to put a shovel in there to fill out the bag,
and with the camping equipment, to the shape of the thing.</p>

<p>I never&mdash;I didn't put these in words, they were just kind of thoughts in the
back part of my mind. I wasn't particularly curious about it. I just had
to move this object and I think I have told you about the full extent of my
thinking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long would you estimate the package to be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The package was about that long. That is 40 inches long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let's get a ruler and have you indicate. Would you indicate,
Mr. Paine, on the edge of the desk here approximately how long you think the
package was and then I will measure what you have indicated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I guess about that. That is including the blanket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The witness has indicated a length of 37½ inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You had two twelves. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, you say that was including the blanket, what do you mean
by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, the blanket was wrapped around the end of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was it wrapped tightly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Pretty snug.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you moved it did you have the impression that there
might have been any paper inside of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I would have said no; I didn't have that impression. Nothing
crinkled, no sound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you moved it several times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there any indication by a crinkling or otherwise that there
might be paper wrapped inside the blanket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, you said before that you had thought that they didn't
make camping equipment out of iron anymore. What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I had had camping equipment, of course, camping equipment
we had was a tent with iron pipes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What prompted you to think of that thought in connection with
this particular package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I suppose it was the&mdash;I had a .22 when I was a kid.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. A .22 caliber rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I had two of them. I kept that in better condition, I mean,
this was a rustic looking blanket, it looked as though it had been kicked around.
It was dusty, and it seemed to me it was wrapped with a twine or something,
tied up with a twine. So I thought of, it looked to me like the kind of blanket
I had used for a bed roll on the ground.</p>

<p>I suppose that is the thought that started me thinking in the line of camping
equipment. And then I suppose I must have felt, I felt a pipe, at least, and
maybe some sense of there being more than one pipe but I drew that picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>
that I drew, I didn't sense that there being another pipe I didn't put it in
because I never did place another pipe around it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never placed another <span class="locked">pipe&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had the idea there might have been more than one pipe here
or I didn't know where the other pipe might be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At the time you picked it up, at any time that you picked it up,
did you have the idea that there might be more than two pipes inside the
package.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I would never have mentioned camping equipment, you
see, without, you can't make anything without more than one pipe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Think of the configuration of the package or of the way it
acted when you moved it, was there any indication in that sense that there was
more than one pipe inside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I think it was a homogenous, that is to say it didn't move
one part with respect to another.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was it tied tightly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was tied quite firmly. It seemed to me the blanket was wrapped
double or something that the blanket itself would have made two pipes trying to
hold still in the blanket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How wide was the package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, apparently, it was lopsided because I remember not being able
to fit the shovel in it, but if you are to draw that outline or something, I think
that would go around the blanket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you want to draw something additional here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was smaller at this end. It was smaller at this one end and
that was generally the end that I carried in my right hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you mark the area on the drawing that you are indicating,
mark it with an "A" on the drawing. And you indicate that it was smaller
at the end marked "A" than at the other end or it was not as wide?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can't remember how it was wrapped at this end because I could
grab my hand around the paper whereas this end, I think was folded over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You say that the blanket, you think the blanket was folded over
at the other end opposite from "A"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I don't know, there were two separate different thoughts at
the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now you have drawn a solid line completely around the first
drawing that you made on No. 1?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I don't think I made this one, my solid line should be much
longer. It should have gone out there. I will scratch it out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Okay. The witness is scratching out the first line at end "B"
and drawing in another line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This is the widest dimension here, and I was indicating, between
7 and 8 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mark that "C".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now the witness has stated that the dimension marked "C" on
the drawing was approximately 7 or 8 inches. Would you mark a "B" at the
end opposite from "A" on the drawing so we can keep the record straight as to
what we have been talking about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. [Marking.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. We have now gotten two dimensions roughly of the package,
the length and the height.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My hand went around it pretty well, it didn't close around it but
it went around it to the grabbing of the fashion where the pipe went actually
through my fingers and thumb.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did your hand actually close around it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It did not close around it. At the other end I grabbed it when I
picked it up, grabbing it, I will draw my fingers here. This is the thumb.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The witness has <span class="locked">sketched&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. In that fashion there. That was, say, 2 inches thick with the
blanket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Witness has drawn at the end marked "B" his hand indicating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
how he picked it up and said that at that end it was about 2 inches thick, including
the blanket.</p>

<p>When you grabbed it at that end could you tell whether the blanket was
wrapped tight up around the object that was inside or whether it was just a
fold of the blanket at that end?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I thought it was, my impression was that it was all tightly
wrapped and that the blanket had strings around it&mdash;I can't recall exactly but
it was tied with strings, I don't remember where the strings were and I thought
the fold in the blanket came up along here somewhere. I thought it was wrapped,
the blanket was folded over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In other words, your testimony is that at end "B"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. But my memory there is so feeble, so uncertain. I remember this
measurement of the pipe because I pictured that in my mind at the time so I was
thinking about that.</p>

<p>I was trying to fit the shovel in and I remember saying that is too asymmetric.
My impression was I would have said that there would have been a fold over it.
I have read since that Marina looked in the end of this package and saw the
butt end of a rifle. Now I didn't remember that it was something easy to look
into like that. I though it was well wrapped up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In the testimony you have just given you have indicated that
the blanket was folded over the end of the object marked "B" on our drawing.</p>

<p>Would you indicate approximately by a line which I will ask you to mark
"D" how far the blanket came up on the object itself, after it was folded over,
the "B" end, can you do that for us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This is totally unreliable as a memory. It was only based on an
impression that I thought it was well wrapped, in other words, dirt wouldn't
be sifting into the inside of the package. I put it under the saw, right below
where the saw sifts the sawdust out so I was concerned not getting these things
dirty. So I will draw a line here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, in the drawing you have made for us you have indicated
this object inside the package, you have drawn an object and a package, and on
your drawing the object ends before the end of the package does, the steel pipe
that you have drawn.</p>

<p>What impression did you have of what was in the rest of the package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I must have drawn my outline incorrectly. The line of this pipe
here shown didn't&mdash;the package. I must draw another package then. The package
must have sloped.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, do you remember how it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't remember the shape of the package. It was a blanket,
I mean it was a&mdash;reconstruct the blanket or something but this is not a continuous
pipe because it was loose, it was stuck through the outline of the package,
then I drew the package wrong then. I didn't think of it all at one time, you
know. I just had these individual separate thoughts of trying to fit an object
or objects that came to my mind into this package.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your testimony is then that instead of drawing a new package
you think the object you have drawn inside the package should have gone right
to the end of the blanket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; that 30 inches of pipe would have come close to the edge of
the blanket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let me show you <span class="locked">a&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. But here, you see there may have been another pipe alongside of it,
I didn't particularly arrange it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I show you a blanket which has been previously marked as
Commission Exhibit 140, and ask you if that is the blanket that you saw in
the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I think it looks cleaner than it was, than it struck me
then. And I may have said that it had more colors in it but that is the mood
of the colors there.</p>

<p>I think I would have&mdash;I can't absolutely identify this blanket. But green
and brown, it may have also had blue spots in it or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you say that this is not the blanket that was in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
garage? Take your time and examine it as closely as you want to, do anything
you want to with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would guess that&mdash;it looks a little, in here it looks cleaner than
I remember but otherwise it looks&mdash;the light isn't very good in there and I
always moved it around in the dark, I mean in the night time. I had an impression
that it was, it was somewhat more mottling of the colors in it, that
is to say, I can't identify this absolutely.</p>

<p>It is a very good substitute for it, a good resemblance or good candidate for,
my memory of the blanket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, there were lights in the garage, were there not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you would have them on when you were working in
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You said at one point you stored the blanket under your saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You had lights near your saw, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is very dark there. There is a light on the saw but that shines
on the table.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There is no light directly over the saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; there is one light in the garage out in the middle of the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you say that at any time that you moved the blanket
around in the garage that you would have had enough light to determine the
colors of the blanket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The green and the brown, those colors were in that blanket. I
had thought there was, it was dirtier, and I would have put blue spots with
it, something like that to make it fully come up to the impression I had of the
blanket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And those blue spots would have been a part of the pattern of
the blanket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember whether the design of this blanket, Commission
Exhibit 148, is approximately the same as the design on the blanket
which you saw in your garage or was it different?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't remember the design of the blanket I saw in the garage.
I think somewhat, I didn't, if I had been the least bit curious I could have at
least felt of this blanket but I was aware of personal privacy, so I don't investigate
something.</p>

<p>Now what comes to my hand from touching the thing unavoidably I am
free to think about, but I think I was aware of not looking through his belongings,
the moral dictate. I know I was aware of that, I remember. I remember
that feeling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What about the texture of this blanket, does it seem like the
blanket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; that is a <span class="locked">good&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It is similar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This blanket we have here is sewn around the edges with
brown thread, is it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Around some of the edges at any rate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you recall seeing anything like that on the blanket that
was in the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't know, but I didn't look at it that closely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, a part of that exhibit is a piece of string. When I unfolded
the blanket, Commission Exhibit 140, a piece of string was found to be
present, and I would like to ask the reporter to mark it as the next exhibit
on this deposition.</p>

<p>(The string referred to was marked Michael Paine Exhibit No. 2 for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I ask you, Mr. Paine, whether that piece of string which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
been marked as Exhibit 2 on this deposition is similar to or different from
the string that was used to tie this package up when you saw it in the garage,
if you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't remember exactly. I think this is a very good candidate
again. I remember thinking it was wrapped in a twine, by which I meant
it was not wrapped in a cotton, tight wound expensive cotton, string. I didn't
think it was wrapped, didn't have in mind the manila type or sisal type. This is
the right strength. I can't actually remember whether it was or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It appears to be similar?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is about as good as could come to my memory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there just one string wrapped on the blanket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I think it was wrapped at both ends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. With two strings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well now this blanket has a pin in one end. I call your attention
to that, the blanket which is Commission Exhibit 140. Did you notice that
pin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Present in the blanket at the time it was in your garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't think I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I am going to lay the blanket out here on the conference table,
and I am going to produce Commission Exhibit 139 which is the rifle that was
found in the Texas School Book Depository Building on November 22, 1963, and
I will ask you if you can construct out of these materials that we have here
this rifle, and the blanket and the string something that resembles or duplicates
the package that you saw in your garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It seemed to me this end up here was not as bulky as the <span class="locked">whole&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Redlich</span>. By "this end" what do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. "A", I have drawn as "A", was not as bulky as if I had wrapped it
and pulled the blanket over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are having difficulty in making it as small as when you
remember it in the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. We want you just to continue to work with it and take your time
because we want you to be able to satisfy yourself to the fullest extent possible,
on this question, one way or the other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is getting fairly close but I don't know what he did with this end.
This way of wrapping it seems to combine the functions. I also had a notion
that it was somehow folded over but it seems too thick to do it that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, you have wrapped the rifle in the blanket. I will ask you
if this appears to be, this wrapped package appears to be similar to the one you
saw in your garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I should say this end was a little bit too big here and it is not
quite big enough here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you say this end, you are referring to the end marked
"B" on the drawing, which in the package is the end, the butt end of the rifle,
isn't that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You say that end is too thick.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. As I have it wrapped.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes; and you say in the center of the package in which we have
the rifle wrapped you say that is not thick enough. But by thick enough do you
mean the width or the actual thickness of the package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I thought of the package pretty much as all of the same thickness,
calling the width from type&mdash;calling the rifle and the scope of the rifle the width.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The width?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The width across the bolt, the direction of the bolt as the thickness.
So I thought of it as a more or less constant thickness of the package and not
quite so&mdash;I would have to wrap it in some manner to move some of this bulk up
into here, but I don't want to do it so much that I can't grab that feel of pipe.</p>

<p>That feels, it is quite a lot like it and there could almost have been two pipes
there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you say it is quite a lot like it you grasped the "A" end
of the rifle or the muzzle of the rifle, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are we saying now that its thickness is not as you remember the
package in your garage or the same width?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, most likely this end down here is perhaps, the butt end of
the rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The "B" end?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. As I have it wrapped is a little bit too full.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you think that appears to be <span class="locked">thicker&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Than the package that was in your garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And as far as the middle is concerned, you say that is what,
not as thick nor not as wide?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; somehow it should be a little wider, or a little fuller.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It was a package which wasn't quite so tapering?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Quite so tapered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is that approximately the length of the package that you
remember in your garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I think that is good. I grabbed it in some way or another,
I don't know what he did with this end.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Referring to the "A"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was a string, there were two strings on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you estimated the length of the package before, would
you have estimated it with the flap of the blanket that is now on the "A" end
folded over or extended a little bit as it happens to be in this particular package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't think it was&mdash;I think the package is still all right if you
fold it over, and I would not, the length I was estimating was the kind of length
that I would grab there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So you think that the length would be more appropriate if you
folded this flap over here at "A"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you measure the length of that package and tell us what
it is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is 41 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, after going through the process that we have gone
through here, of trying to wrap this rifle in this blanket, do you think that
the package that you saw in your garage could have been a package containing
a rifle similar to the one we have here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I think so. This has the right weight and solidness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did you estimate, did you ever estimate, the weight of
that package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't think I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever tell the FBI approximately how much you thought
it weighed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, I may have said 7 or 8 pounds. But that was all after the
fact. I mean I didn't do it at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever discuss with the FBI the question of whether
or not the object in the package that you saw, let's assume for the moment that
it was a rifle, did you ever discuss with the FBI whether the rifle could have
had a telescopic sight mounted on it or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't remember whether I discussed that with the FBI. I haven't
thought much about it. I didn't feel in the area of the package where the
sight is. In my memory of the tubes, I did picture more than one tube.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You did picture more than one <span class="locked">tube&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I didn't picture it anywhere. I assumed there was going to be&mdash;there
was more than one tube. I hadn't placed it in any picture therefore that
it <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you <span class="locked">say&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think I assumed that, I think, because this line along the top
of the package was not straight enough to be the tube I have drawn there. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
should say, in other words, either the bulk of the package as well as the out in
the middle or there could have been a sight there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did the FBI or any other investigatory agency of the Government
ever show you a picture of the rifle that was supposed to have been used
to assassinate the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They asked me at first, the first night of the assassination if I
could locate, identify the place where Lee was standing when he was holding
this rifle and some, the picture on the cover of Life.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you able to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I identified the place by the fine clapboard structure of the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. By the what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. By the small clapboard structure, the house has an unusually
small clapboard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did you identify the place as being?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The Neely Street address. He didn't drive a car, so to have them
over for dinner I had to go over and pick them up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever tell the FBI that at first you felt if the object
was a gun in the package it did not have a scope on it, but after seeing pictures
of the gun and noting the small size of the scope on the weapon used to assassinate
the President that the object you lifted could have been a rifle with the
scope mounted on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't remember saying that; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember being interviewed by FBI agents Odum and
Peggs on November 24, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, of course, I have seen Bob Odum frequently. Peggs is an
unfamiliar name. It doesn't mean he couldn't have been there. That night
I mostly went into the police station, spent much of it at the police station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. On November 24?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Is that a Sunday night or Monday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Sunday, the 24th would be a Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am too confused. Maybe it was on the next night that I spent
at the police station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, let's go back and tell us about as best as you can recall
how many times did the FBI interview you starting with the day of the assassination,
the 22d of November. Did the FBI interview you on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There was someone at the police station, first the police took us
to the station and asked us questions and we filled out an affidavit right in
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That is the Dallas Police Station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The Dallas police, and after they were finished someone from the
FBI, I believe, asked me some questions. It was almost as though he had no&mdash;by
leave of the police that he could do this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember the name of that agent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Now, I don't believe I met, I was introduced to, Odum prior to the
22d. I do not remember that man, and it is possible that&mdash;I don't think it
was Odum, but I wouldn't recall that out and I do not remember the name of
that man. I don't know what he looks like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you interviewed by the FBI on Saturday, November 23?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am not going to be able to remember when I was interviewed
without being able to have something to hang it on. There were news reporters.
First the news reporters were more in evidence, and then the police came out
again, and both of them stick in my mind more because they are more objectionable.
I mean there is <span class="locked">more&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would it refresh your recollection if I mentioned the name of
Richard E. Harrison as an FBI agent who interviewed you on November 22,
1963, at the Dallas police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. I don't remember the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Reconstruct for us the events of Saturday, November 23 as best
you can. And perhaps I can help you if I ask you first, did you stay in your
apartment in Grand Prairie the night of the assassination, the night of the 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I don't think so. No, we had a late supper there. Life reporters
were there, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At Irving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. At Irving, and then they came again early next morning and I
was there with the family in the morning so I must have been there at night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And the Life reporters came on Saturday morning again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The 23d. What happened, how long did they stay and what
happened after they left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, they left quite early, I think, it might have been 9 o'clock,
relatively speaking, 9 or 9:30, talking to Marina Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did you do after they left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't remember. I think I went over to the Irving apartment,
I mean the Grand Prairie apartment, at some time during the day, I don't
remember what for. I had in mind, there was something I was trying to do,
I can't remember now what it was, I mean something I would have been doing
on the weekend. So, between, let's say, they left at 9:30, and about 5 o'clock,
I don't remember what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you go to your place of business at any time, to the Bell
Helicopter plant on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, my apartment was close by it. I think somebody has asked
me this question before and I think at the time I said no, and I don't remember
now, that is my closest memory to that occasion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your recollection is that you did not go to the helicopter plant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. My recollection now is now fuzzier than ever but I recall previously
I thought about it and I said, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you go to the police station in Dallas on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. I recall the FBI came, not the FBI, the Dallas police came
and took me in their car. We went back via Grand Prairie which was out of
the way and the sun was about setting so that was about 5:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you come back to Irving after you left the Dallas Police
Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, probably 8 or 9 at night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you stay at Irving that evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think I probably stayed Saturday evening and went back, spent
Sunday evening in Grand Prairie so I could get to work easily the next morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember talking to your wife on the telephone on
Saturday, November 23?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I may have called her from the police station or something like
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I am going to unwrap the package with the rifle which was
wrapped in the blanket, and I want to ask you if you had ever seen this rifle,
Commission Exhibit 139, before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not to my&mdash;the first time I saw a rifle, I didn't realize that he
had a rifle. I thought, I knew he liked rifles because he spoke fondly of them
in the Soviet Union although he regretted that he couldn't own a rifle, and I
supposed that he still didn't have one so I didn't see a rifle until the night of the
22d when Marina was shown a rifle in an adjoining cubicle glass between us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You observed through the glass a rifle being shown to Marina
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you hear any of the questions being asked her at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I couldn't hear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did your wife see this rifle being shown to Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She was in the room with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. She was in the room with Marina Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, after Marina Oswald was shown this rifle, did your wife
tell you anything about the questions that were asked of Marina Oswald at that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; she said Marina couldn't, wasn't able to, identify the rifle.
I can't remember now whether she said she knew it was a rifle because she had
looked in and seen the butt end of a rifle but didn't&mdash;I think this is what she said
at the time <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This is <span class="locked">what&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I will say it again. I think Ruth reported at that time, or this is
a recollection I have of a report that Ruth made and I think it was at that time,
that Marina said she couldn't identify this rifle. She knew that Oswald had a
rifle, and she knew that it was in a package wrapped in the blanket in the
garage, but that she had only seen it accidentally when she had discovered what
it was accidentally when she had looked in the corner of the package and saw
the butt end of a rifle but she didn't like rifles, made her nervous or something to
that effect so she didn't look at the whole rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Ruth tell you anything that Marina Oswald said about the
presence or absence of a telescopic sight on the rifle at that interview with the
Dallas police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't remember anything that she may have said about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you are quite clear that your wife told you that Marina
had said that she could not identify the rifle that was shown to her as being
the rifle that was owned by Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, I want to draw your attention specifically to a sling or a
device that serves the purpose of sling on this rifle, which is Commission Exhibit
139, and ask you if you have ever seen anything like that before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am taking your question to mean did I see it on the rifle, a sling
on the rifle I saw that was shown to Marina? I don't think I can truthfully
remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I also want you to consider whether you have ever seen a
<span class="locked">device&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I have never seen a sling built like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you ever seen any device that looks like this at all whether
it was designed for a rifle or for any other purpose? Do you have any idea
what this might be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't recognize it. I have never seen it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't remember ever having seen anything like this around
your own house or garage in Irving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, we have here the parts of a rifle which is similar to the
Commission Exhibit 139, and I will lay these on the blanket, and I will ask the
reporter to indicate on the record that the counterpart rifle has been identified
by FBI No. C-250. I want to ask you, Mr. Paine, to try to wrap this in the
package, the broken down rifle and see if that works out any better or any worse
than the attempt we made to wrap the complete rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I guess all that happened was I lifted up the thing in the same
fashion. I don't think that is going to help the problem. It makes the package
a little bit shorter but that other package&mdash;I wouldn't have got the sense of pipe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The witness indicates that because of the stock and the rifle
barrel are separate when the rifle is broken down, it seems natural, does it not,
Mr. Paine, to place the barrel and action of the rifle directly over the top of the
stock when wrapping it this way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. If you do that, you would not have the sense of grasping the
muzzle of the rifle or of a pipe when you picked up the package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And this, putting the barrel below the stock, doesn't leave, offset
the package in the way that gave me the problem with the folding shovel in
there. The symmetrical shovel if I wrapped that in some fashion. Also it
mustn't rattle. He is going to have to tie it firmly with string not to have it
as monolithic or solid as it had been. The barrel, I must have just felt the
barrel, I felt a pipe, and the barrel had to be sticking out beyond the stock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You think that because the barrel of the rifle had to be sticking
out behind the stock and because when the rifle is placed in the package
in two different pieces, it is difficult to tie it tightly enough to keep it from
rattling and you would infer that the rifle was put together when it was in
the package in your garage, assuming that there was a rifle in the package in
the garage? Did you ever tell the FBI that you were sure in the light of
recent events that you were sure it was a rifle in the package?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I told the FBI the description or the suggestion of a rifle as
the object brought together these loose pieces or loose concepts on the offset
bulk which was the butt end, and the pipe, the 30-inch pipe I drew in the
picture, so it made sense. The picture jelled when the rifle was suggested
as an object.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And so you concluded that it was likely that there was, in
fact, a rifle in the package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I thought that was so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I show you Commission Exhibit 364, which is a replica of a
paper sack or package which was found in the School Book Depository, after
the assassination. I point out to you that Commission 364 is merely a replica
of the actual sack that was found. The actual sack that was found is Commission
Exhibit 142, and it has now been discolored because it has been treated by
the FBI for fingerprints.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But there is a part of the package that has not been treated,
and I ask you if that part of 142 that has not been treated is similar to Commission
Exhibit 364 as far as color and texture are concerned. I want you
to examine both of these pieces of paper in any event.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, it looks to me as if 364 is a more usual kind of paper, the
difference is pretty slight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You do not notice a difference between the two papers, however?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; is seems to me that is unusually crisp; yes, I would say
there is a difference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you note that the difference is, 142 is more crisp than 364?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. It seems to me this is the kind of paper, it seems to me
this is more common.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Referring to 364?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. 364, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you think that is a more commonly observed type of
paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; that is an unusual paper. You don't find paper bags made
of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Referring to 142. Now, examine, after examining both 142
and 364, did you have any paper of that type as far as you know in your
garage or at your home in Irving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, most of the things that are paper have been added to the
garage since I moved out, so I am not very familiar with them. We stored
some rugs in, I think, in polyethylene, but I am not sure all of them were in
polyethylene, and there were some curtain rods or something like that which
are still there. I don't know how they came.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What kind of curtain rods?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. These expanding rods that <span class="locked">are&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you have no idea where they came from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Let's see, no, those came down from&mdash;I think those were in the
house, I guess they weren't bought. I think Ruth took them down because
the children were allergic to something, and she was taking them down, took
down the curtains, and left only shades. Bought shades, I guess, she bought
curtain shades to go up, new shades. That is a question, well, of course, paper
could have been&mdash;I don't remember any particular, I didn't have any rolls of
this kind of paper or a supply of it, wrapping paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let's go back to the curtain rods for just a minute. You
say they were in the house at the time in Irving when you purchased the
house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, curtain rods came to my mind recently because they are
junk that I try to keep propped up on the shelves or above the work bench,
and I think they were in our house and there were curtains on them and she
took the curtains down to get rid of the fabric that might be holding dust
and put up instead some new curtains, new window shades in the bedrooms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Approximately when did she do that, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. You will have to ask Ruth herself. She put down a new floor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span>
also, getting rid of the old rugs for the same purpose, and I thought it was in
the fall, but I can't place when it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In the fall of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you say the curtain rods are still in the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Approximately how long are they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I think this is, when they expand, I guess the curtain rods
themselves are 32½ inches to 3 feet, but the two of them slide together to make a
pair, this expanding type just of rod metal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Approximately how long are they, would you say, when they
are fitted together and in their collapsed state or <span class="locked">their&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. As I say, those came out of the house or she would not have,
I was trying to think of some of the paper she might have had that resembles
this, but the thing she bought new would be the shades, the window shades to
go in place of those curtain rods.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember seeing any paper in the garage that might
have been a package in which those shades came?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I don't recall any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever have a conversation with your wife about these
curtain rods in connection with the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No. I think we did both read that he had said he was, to Frazier,
that he was carrying, maybe it was curtain rods or something to do with
windows in my mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But your wife didn't mention to you that Oswald ever mentioned
to her anything about the curtains rods?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, place yourself in the garage on or about November 21,
22, 1963, or shortly before that time, and tell me everything that you can remember
as being in that garage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, there is a bench along, in front of, a fiberglass window panel.
That bench is generally covered with boxes, there are boxes underneath that
bench. On the end of the bench is a drill press. My recollection is confused
by the fact I am much more familiar with it now that I have moved back and
I have moved my stuff into that garage, so it is fuzzy in my memory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were you present on November 22 when the police or the FBI
or any other authorities searched the garage?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What time did you get to the Irving house on the 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think just about 3 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. 3 o'clock on Friday afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What were the circumstances under which you first heard of
the assassination on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was eating lunch in the bowling alley, and the waitress came
and told me. I thought she was joking, and we went and listened to somebody's
transistor, and then I went back to the lab.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At that time you had heard only that the President had been
shot, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There was no connection with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And the assassination at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right. Went back to the lab and <span class="locked">then&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Before you get back to the lab let me ask you this, who was with
you at the first time you heard the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Dave Noel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was Mr. Krystinik with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you hear during this first period of time when you first
heard of the assassination, that the President had been shot near the Texas
School Book Depository?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't believe so. I think, I heard that he had been shot, I
listened over some of the crowd's shoulders, a little cluster of people listening
to a transistor radio thereby knowing it was no joke, so we went back to the
lab where there is a radio. So I didn't hear it until I got back to the lab. As
soon as I got back to the lab it was not very long after that that it was mentioned,
that the Texas School Book Depository Building was mentioned, and then
I mentioned to Frank Krystinik that is where Lee worked, and then in the
course of the next half hour Frank and I were discussing whether to report
to the FBI that Lee worked there, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell me what you said and what he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was urging me to do it, and or asking whether I didn't think
we should do it, and I was torn but I came up with the decision no, the FBI
already knows he works there. Everybody will be jumping on him because he
is a black sheep, and I didn't want to join the hysterical mob in his harassment.
So I decided I wouldn't call, I didn't say that I couldn't but I said I wasn't
going to call the FBI on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you told him that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I think he accepted it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did it occur to you at that time that Oswald had in fact had
anything to do with the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, of course, it did, I am sure it made by heart leap to hear
that building mentioned. But I thought&mdash;I didn't see how it helped the causes
that he presumably was concerned about, so I thought it unlikely on that
account alone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you think he was capable of doing that at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We heard or somewhere I read or heard a report, and an eye
witness, presumably eye witness, report saying the man who was shooting the
President took his good old time or, in other words, fired with deliberateness.
This seemed in character.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. With Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. With Oswald, yes. I don't think he was a person with compassion,
or&mdash;the only reason I didn't think he was because I didn't see how it
fitted in with his philosophy or how it was going to forward his causes, not
because it seemed&mdash;not because it was not possible to his nature or his character.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you call Ruth after you learned of the assassination and
prior to the time that you heard <span class="locked">Oswald&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, I did call her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did you say and what did she say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We said very little. That must have been, I guess I called her
immediately getting back to the lab, so she would be watching and listening
and getting clued in to the news, start watching the news. That must have
also been before the Texas Book Depository Building was mentioned because
I would have mentioned that I didn't. I just&mdash;we said almost nothing <span class="locked">except&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you talk to her after you learned that the TSBD was
involved, but before you learned that Oswald was suspected of being involved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I don't believe I called her again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you subsequently learn that Oswald had been arrested?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. As soon as I heard his name mentioned, then I went home.
His name, of course, was mentioned not in connection with the Texas Book
Depository Building but simply as a person caught in the theatre. But that
was enough connection for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Because you knew he did work at the TSBD?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, of course, Frank and I were having this heart-wrenching
discussion about the right thing to do. And justification for my action was
based on the thought that he was probably not the one and, therefore, it was
a cruelty to be adding to the harassment that he would inevitably encounter
because anyone who knew him for very long surely knew his views. That is he
would, he would be a black sheep in any crowd of Americans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let's go back to the question of this paper. Do you have any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>
recollection of ever seeing any paper like either one of these two samples in front
of you, 142 and 364, in or about your place in Irving, Tex.?</p>

<p>And in connection with this question consider also the gummed wrapping
tape with which the packages are reconstructed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We have a roll of gummed wrapping paper at home but this is 3
inches wide and we have 2-inch wide. Do you have a ruler here? Yes, this is
3-inch tape.</p>

<p>Now I don't remember for certain what the tape is we had at home, but I had
the impression it was a 2-inch tape.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any recollection that the authorities inquired about
this question before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I don't recall that question at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you still have that tape?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes, we do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I would like to have you make sure that it doesn't get lost
when we come down to Dallas within the next week or two. We will ask you
some more questions about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. All right. Do you want me to make a note of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In fact, I will ask you if you would, when you return to
Irving, if you would take a sample of that tape and mail it to me at the Commission
so that between now and the time I come to Texas the FBI will have
an opportunity to examine it and compare it with the tape which has been used
in making bags. Do you recall whether that tape was at your premises on
November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think so. It has been there for quite a long time. That is
presumably. I don't think it has been used up. I was using it fairly recently.
I didn't use much so it would still be there, and I think it had been a big roll
and now it is a small roll. We don't use much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where was it located on the 22d of November, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; there is a drawer which it is possible he knew of. The desk&mdash;I
think he helped us move the furniture around at that time the desk was moved
to its present position, which is right beside the garage door. There is a
kitchen-dining area and from that the door leads into the garage and it is right
beside that door in the bottom drawer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What about the paper. Do you think that there is any possibility
that Oswald could have gotten the paper from which he presumably
made this bag at your place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I don't recognize that paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Referring to 142?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Or as I say, this looks more common or cheaper grade of paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Referring to 364.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And I don't remember paper of either kind, of course, in the
garage itself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any recollection of the authorities inquiring about
the presence or absence of paper like this at your place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any discussions about any questions which the
FBI or the other authorities may have asked your wife about this question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't remember anything on it. One way or the other about
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. To the best of your recollection the subject has never been
mentioned between yourself and your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am certain that I have never discussed tape with anyone. I
did know it was reported in the paper that Lee went to work that morning with
something wrapped in brown paper, curtain rods, I guess he did call it. Whether
we, had some discussion or I think it is&mdash;we may have had some discussion. I
just don't remember the burden of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I have a list of names of people who I think lived in the Dallas
and Fort Worth area and I want to ask you whether you know them or whether
their names are familiar to you. Mr. and Mrs. Peter Gregory?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. The name has been mentioned. Ruth, I think. Russian speaking
people, Ruth has mentioned the name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You have never met them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any recollection of what Ruth told you about
them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't believe she had met them either. No, I don't recall what
she said about them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she tell you that she had called Mr. Peter Gregory in connection
with some work she wanted to do in the Russian language, subsequent
to the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't remember the context in which she mentioned Peter
Gregory's name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Max Clark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is an unfamiliar name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Gali Clark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I don't know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Elena Hall, Mrs. John Hall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, I don't remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mr. George Bouhe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Anna Meller?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Anna Ray?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And that is Mr. and Mrs. Frank Ray?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. George De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was, the name there is familiar. I don't believe I have
met them. They were friends of Everett Glover and then Everett Glover moved
to their house later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Moved into De Mohrenschildt's house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; they were, they had been in Haiti for a while, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Mr. Glover tell you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never met De Mohrenschildt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I have&mdash;Everett gave some parties to which we went, it is possible
that I&mdash;for practical purposes I had not met them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't know anything about them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald ever speak of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think he did, yes, yes; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember what he said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I remember, I don't remember what he said about them. I was&mdash;it
is possibly because he said the name twice and I didn't catch it until after
the second time he had spoken of it or it didn't ring a bell, De Mohrenschildt
didn't ring a bell, or he didn't pronounce it with such clarity or something. So
it didn't really register and I didn't connect it up with whatever he was saying
at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Gary and Alexandra Taylor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tatiana Biggers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Everett had&mdash;Biggers doesn't sound like the right name. At one
time Everett was&mdash;had a ballet dancer that had some kind of a name like that.
He introduced me to a&mdash;I think we met at a theater and he introduced me to
some&mdash;let's say no; I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The name previously mentioned, Mr. Everett Glover, is he a
close friend of yours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We have known him a long time since we have been in Dallas. We
met the Glovers at madrigal singing, we liked to sing madrigals, and he was
part of the group and his wife used to sing at the Unitarian Church in the choir
where I sing, and they were separated two years ago probably and I have seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span>
him only occasionally when he would go to the madrigals and once I went skating
with him. Occasionally we have met also at the theater center. He has been
there also. Occasionally also I have stopped by&mdash;there is a&mdash;he showed up
once or twice at a single adult party dance of the Unitarian Church.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He doesn't work with Bell Helicopter, does he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he works for an oil company, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He is a geologist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He may be something of that sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Richard Pierce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; he lived with Everett Glover.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How well do you know him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I know him much less than Everett. When we visited Everett's
house for a sing or something, I think I would meet him, and he also would
come to these single adult parties&mdash;but I don't <span class="locked">know&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What about Mr. and Mrs. Norman Fredricksen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That name doesn't ring a bell either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Volkmar Schmidt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He is in that same category with Mr. Pierce living with Everett
and occasionally showing up at the stag parties.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know a Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Ray?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't think I know Ray.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Ilya Mamantov?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I suppose that is Mr. Mamantov whom I recognize by sight but
I may have shaken his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How do you have occasion to recognize him by sight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, he is the son-in-law, if Ilya is the right name&mdash;I don't know,
I know him as Mr. Mamantov, Ruth's tutor, I have forgotten his name at this
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Dorothy Gravitis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is right. And I have seen him around SMU and he was
an interpreter at the police station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know anybody by the name of Harten?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Warner Kloepfer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Has Ruth ever spoken to you of the Kloepfers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. My understanding is they lived there in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, then I don't know them. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know a Charles Edward Harris?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Florence McDonald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I know Elizabeth MacDonald, I think it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who is she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She was a friend of&mdash;she would come to these madrigal groups and
I think she a a friend of either of Everett or of Pierce or something like that.
It was in connection with the madrigal sings and I think they were the ones who
brought them into circulation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know Col. J.&nbsp;D. Wilmeth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't know him. A colleague at work lives nearby who
shares a well with him and keeps it repaired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Who does?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Clark Benham, another colleague at work, uses the water from
Colonel Wilmeth's well and has to keep the well operating so I hear stories about
Mr. Wilmeth and he lives with his old, ancient mother. I haven't met him myself,
I don't believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned that&mdash;did you mention that he called you at your
office at one time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I think he has, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us the circumstances of that event?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, he wanted to see Marina, I think, he wanted to hear, I think
he said he wanted to hear the native tongue spoken or spoken by a native. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>
so he was quite eager to meet both Ruth and Marina and called me to ask how
and when and what not. So, he may have called me more than once on that
subject.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any idea why he called you at work? In order to
contact these women?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It seemed very appropriate. Maybe Clark, Clark, of course, sees
him quite frequently, and maybe Clark told him that Marina was living with us.
I cannot&mdash;I could be clued in. I remember at the time there was a reason for it.
I mean it seemed appropriate, it wasn't out of the blue, but I can't&mdash;unless it was
that I had been talking about Marina with Clark and then Clark told it to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never have met Colonel Wilmeth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Ruth ever tell you that Colonel Wilmeth had come to call on
her and Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; that call or one or two calls he made to the lab to me was
asking me if I would make it possible for him to meet them and so I told Ruth,
and either Ruth called or I told her that he was, he would like to come on the
weekend or something or he would call, I forget, but anyway I was a go-between
to help in a polite way to meet Ruth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Ruth tell you about the meeting when he came?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She did; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think she said she had a good time, I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember any of the details of what she said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't remember the details; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know a gentleman by the name of Clifton M. Shasteen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He is a barber in Irving, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you ordinarily get your hair cut in Irving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I used to get my hair cut, and I don't think that is the name of the
person or where it used to be done but for the year that I was living in Grand
Prairie, I found a barber I liked better over there and I had it done over there
all the time, almost all the time. I guess I haven't in months. I had another
barber down in Irving and got a bad haircut.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How much does a haircut cost in Irving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think more frequently it is a dollar fifty; when I get it over in
Grand Prairie it is a dollar and a quarter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is there a standard price so far as you know for barber shops in
Irving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I would suppose a dollar and fifty was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever know Oswald to associate with any young boys?
There has been a report that he was seen in the presence of, in the company of
a 14-year-old boy. Do you know of anyone fitting that description?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know of anyone with whom he associated. I didn't&mdash;I was
aware of not asking him how he spent his free time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. There has also been a report from Mr. Leonard Edwin Hutchinson
who apparently runs Hutch's Supermarket in Irving that Oswald came in there
on a certain day and asked to cash a two-party check for $189. Have you ever
heard anything about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I haven't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know Mr. Hutchison?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't believe I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know, are you familiar with Hutch's Market, Supermarket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I am trying to think of the name of the market that is on Storey
Road, not Storey, Shady Lane&mdash;Shady Grove Road or Lane, that is, if he isn't on
that address then I don't know where it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever take Oswald to any supermarket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I didn't; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever use your automobile?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Not to my knowledge. Presumably he couldn't drive. He couldn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span>
have used my automobile very well because I don't believe he knew where my
second key was, and I would always have the key.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What kind of an automobile do you own?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It is a French Citroen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What model?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. 1959; year 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Not a 2CV?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; it is an ID-19, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is that the only automobile that you own?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. While they were here I bought a second automobile; an Olds, '55
or '56 Oldsmobile, '56, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. During the time, sometime between September and November, I
bought a secondhand '56 Oldsmobile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. For your own personal use?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So that you then had two cars?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And Ruth has a station wagon, doesn't she?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And that is her own car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is that the only automobile that she owns?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What model is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. '55.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Chevrolet station wagon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether Oswald used that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Ruth took Oswald to practice driving in a parking lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she tell you about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did she tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I can't remember whether she has told me so much more since
November 22 and I can't remember whether she may have said before that.
She was telling me how he was persistent, diligent in trying to learn, not very
particularly skilled, and apparently quite pleased at the whole process. He
was grateful to her and one of the nicest kinds of communication she had with
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she say anything about his ability to drive a car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She thought it was pretty crude. He was having trouble operating
the clutch, and over-controlling the stick, or the steering wheel. Those are
my words. She didn't use "over-controlling" but put it in some other way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The station wagon has a straight transmission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; it is an automatic transmission, power brakes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was he practicing on the station wagon <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; over-controlling the stick, I was thinking of an airplane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I thought you mentioned the clutch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Maybe it was the brake; did I mention the clutch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At any event she wasn't overly impressed with his ability to
manipulate the controls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She was impressed with how much a person has to learn when
they learn to drive a car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever lend Oswald any money?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever give him any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether your wife did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't believe she gave Lee any money. She gave Marina
pocket money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any idea of how much she gave Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Generally she would pay for things that Marina needed, medicines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>
and things like that. I think she also gave her pocket money. It may have
been five dollars a week or something like that. It could have been ten dollars
a week. I doubt if it would be that much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any knowledge of Oswald spending any money
for bus fare from Dallas, between Dallas and Irving or anywhere else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He would come out and I suppose by bus to Irving. I do remember
that he came out a couple of times, and then wanted somebody to pick
him up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. At the bus station in Irving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. At the bus station in Irving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you say it was just twice that he did that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think that is about all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any idea what the bus fare from Dallas to Irving
is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I don't have any idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether Oswald spent any money for telephone
calls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I never saw Oswald spend any money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. For anything, under any circumstances at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. Of course, that shouldn't be&mdash;you construe that as you
please, but if you think it is penny-pinching it may be. But I saw him at home
and not in any position to spend money. He didn't have any money jingling
in his pockets that I recalled.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether Oswald owned any cameras?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I wasn't aware of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether he ever bought any records, musical
records?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, they made some records for us, I thought they were Marina's
records. We played some records for them and they wanted to play some for
us or something, so they were records that were Russian singing or something,
I can't remember what it was. It was rather poor fidelity so I didn't enjoy
listening to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know whether Oswald received any periodicals or mail
at your address in Irving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. The Daily Worker, or it is not the Daily Worker now but the
Worker, what is it called now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The Worker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Would come. Ruth said he received all his, The Militant also
there. I don't remember, recall, seeing The Militant there but generally, I didn't
see the mail very much. She would put my mail apart, I had half my mail
or more than half my mail would come to that address, since I didn't feel the
one at Grand Prairie was a permanent address, so I didn't see most of the
mail. She would separate my mail into a separate pile and I would pick it
up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever have any discussion with Oswald about these
periodicals?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. He said in regard to, I think, the Worker or at least it was
the Worker he gave me to look at as the result of his conversation, he told me
if you knew how to read the thing and read between the lines a little bit you
could see what they wanted you to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He said that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did he say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think that was a week or two after he came, pretty soon after
coming back. I talked to him rather less and less as the weeks rolled by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ask him what he meant by that remark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I certainly wish I had, no; I didn't. I took the issue
he gave me just to make my eye go over it. I thought to myself instead here
is a person who is pretty, well, out of it again if this is the way he gets his
communications from headquarters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us everything that you can remember about that conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That wasn't much of a conversation. It happened in an afternoon.
I am afraid I can't remember anything more about it. I remember only
the thoughts, I sort of smiled to myself when he said this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Thinking of the kind of person&mdash;what it said about him so it suggested
to me he wanted to be a party to something or a part of a group that had
objectives. In other words, he wanted to be an activist of some sort. And he
wasn't aware of&mdash;it seemed somewhat childish to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Why do you say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, it would have seemed more competent to have more explicit
communication clandestine, if it would have to be clandestine. And if you had
more explicit communication of some sort you wouldn't mention receiving your
directions from the newspaper, reading between the lines of a newspaper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever say anything to you that would indicate that he had
ever received more explicit instructions from anybody regarding any subject
in the political field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he didn't, and it was these various&mdash;there weren't many occasions.
Another time at the ACLU, in this talk that he had with Frank or
this argument that he had with Frank and a third person on the way home he
asked me if I knew that third person and whether I thought he was a Communist,
and he said he thought he was a Communist, Lee thought the third person
was a Communist, and he gave me some reason and I think it had to do with
a receptivity to some words spoken about Castro. And I thought that was such
a feeble reason or explanation of a Communist that again I thought to myself
he must be out of it if that is the way he has to find his fellow travelers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When you use the expression "out of it" do you mean to convey
the idea that he was not closely associated with any Communist group or he
just had a very tenuous grip on reality?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I mean in this case he was not associated with a cell or a
Communist group. This I didn't know. That was the impression and thought
in the back of my mind from the things he had said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When he made this remark about the person at the ACLU
meeting being a Communist how was the remark made, did he seem to indicate
to you some desire to reach out and to know this person, to meet this person,
to associate with him or was he just making a general remark or were you
thinking in the perjurative sense, how did he speak, what impression did he
give you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I had the impression that he hoped he would be a Communist
and he would like to meet him again, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you notice the person, this third person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was he an elderly person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know a Reverend Helligas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This was not him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you observe Oswald speak with Reverend Helligas that
evening at the meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you ever learned the identity of this third person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I haven't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you ever seen him again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think that is the last ACLU meeting I have been to. They
convene very infrequently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. By that do you mean you have not seen this person again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Therefore, I have not seen him again. I expect he is a registered
member of the ACLU. I had the impression he was an ACLU member. He is
rather softspoken, a quiet man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you recognize him again if you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I probably would.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you discussed him with anybody else in the ACLU?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I joined Frank to the ACLU now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You discussed him with Frank?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; that is Frank Krystinik.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you attempted to identify this third person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I never, I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ever know Oswald to give Marina any money during
the time that Marina lived at your house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When Oswald stayed at your home in Irving on the weekends,
did he eat all of his meals there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I came only for Friday's supper and would leave and would
sometimes be there on Sunday. Therefore, I couldn't be&mdash;I was not in a position
to say. I think he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether he ever made any contribution in respect
to those meals?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Oh, no, he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he make any contribution to any of the other expenses
of the household?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, he didn't. I for one didn't expect him to. I didn't&mdash;I would
have been surprised had he done so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know whether he packed lunch in the morning when
he left for work and took it with him or ate breakfast there before he left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He would eat breakfast there. This again was just what Ruth
has told me, he would eat a breakfast consisting of coffee and maybe a piece
of toast. I forget what it is. I don't believe he packed a lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You do believe?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't believe he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't know of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald ever discuss finances with you or in your presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I raised the problem when he obtained the job at the Book
Depository Building, I mentioned that one and a quarter, I wanted to confirm at
one and a quarter, and I did somehow.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Why did you want to confirm that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It seemed to me that is still a pretty slim pickings to live on, also
I was concerned about how long the job might last, and I inquired, therefore,
about the number of people working there and how come he was employed after
all after the school year began so if he was employed then it was possible that it
was a full year occupation. I would have normally expected the rush of
employment to be prior to the school year. And then to lay off after the books
had been sent. I was concerned in other words that he should be able to keep
his job, but also I would have preferred had it been a little bit more money he
would be a happier person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That later part is your own surmise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; but it is my own experience.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In terms of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was pleased to get the job, and I avoided talking too directly
about the possibility of his losing that job because I felt it was, he would be
concerned about the same matter, and now perhaps I was projecting but I do
remember not asking as many questions about that as were in my mind just
because I didn't want to arouse the anxiety that he must feel in regard to the
job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever indicate to you that he felt that the FBI was responsible
for his not being able to obtain a job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he ever indicate that he thought the FBI was responsible
for his losing a job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; he never mentioned losing a job with me. I surmised from
the first time I met him, he was at the Neely Street address, and Marina was
packing, took about half an hour to leave and Marina was packing things for
Junie. And so he and I sat on the sofa and talked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This is before he went to New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And they were packing to go to New Orleans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No, no; packing to come over to our house for dinner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This was the first time you met him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. And there he mentioned how he didn't have people at work, people
who talked about this subject of politics and economics and he also mentioned
with some bitterness how his employer made more money than he did and the
things that his employer had that he did not have. It was the only time I
observed personal animosity, and I thought to myself, he must be rather difficult,
that animosity or resentment must show through to his employer.</p>

<p>This was just in what he said. It struck me that these things must happen.
When he later lost his job, I don't know whether it was later or not but he may
have lost the job already, I didn't realize it, I thought he was still employed
there. These seemed to me adequate reasons, sub rosa reasons for his dismissal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You never had any indication from anyone that he felt the
FBI was in any way responsible for his losing his job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He never mentioned the FBI to me. And I never talked with
anyone else who knew him except Ruth. Ruth did, of course indicate, told me
of his extreme allergy to the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But she didn't indicate that he felt that they had caused him
to lose jobs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think she mentioned this, she asked me not to mention this to
other people but I guess you are not just other people. She read this note which
he had left on her desk, I had the impression it was a couple of days; actually
it was only a day or so. He had written, typed it but had written a rough draft
which he left on her desk; she gave the note, her copy of it, perhaps, she copied
it for me to read. I didn't really absorb it, I did read it, and I did read he spoke
of the notorious FBI.</p>

<p>Ruth cited the letter to me as an example of how he could lie. She hadn't
been aware of his lying before. She thought his trip to Mexico, which he mentioned
his trip to Mexico in his letter hadn't been true and it was a fabrication,
but it was, we talked, therefore, a little bit about his&mdash;also, I <span class="locked">think&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. His feeling about the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. We talked a little bit about his abuse of the FBI there. And also
I think it was mentioned that, Ruth mentioned to me that, the FBI had been
out once or twice or had reported this to me, and that Lee seemed to resent that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let's go back to this letter, when did Ruth first show you this
letter, and I take it you are referring to a draft of a letter from Oswald to the
Russian Embassy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I didn't know who it was written to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But the letter referred to the notorious FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; I don't think it was the Russian Embassy. I thought it was
a friend to whom he was speaking in a rather braggart way of what he had
done. He had gone down to the Cuban Consulate in Mexico, and they had, I
think this is the letter, I could be mixed up, and that they had not given him a
visa&mdash;actually, I had made a mistake in the heading because I thought&mdash;it said,
"Dear Sirs," but I though it said, "Dear Lisa." Ruth told me it had said, "Dear
Sirs."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This was in Russian or in English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She must have shown me the letter in his hand, therefore, yes.
I thought it was "Dear Lisa," English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did she show you this letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. This is a confusing matter, because I was reading some other magazine
at the time, and she intruded this thing on my attention, and I didn't
really shift attention too well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was it before the assassination or afterwards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It was before, yes. No; afterwards, I would have paid close attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span>
to it. Since recently, I have, Ruth has, figured out that it must have been,
he must have started writing on Friday or something and she cleaned up or
removed the desk, it was that time when we moved the furniture. It had been
written just prior to that, and we did that on a Sunday night. Maybe she preserved
his original draft, I don't remember what happened, because I would have
guessed that in order to misread the "Dear Sirs" for "Dear Lisa," I would have
seen it, I would have read it correctly in her hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Recapitulate for me, if you can, the number of times and the
dates on which you saw Oswald after he returned from New Orleans up until
the time of the assassination. You said you saw him, I believe shortly after
he returned from wherever he had been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And that was around October 4, was it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The first part of October. When was the next time you saw
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I think I probably saw him on each weekend except the one preceding
the assassination. There were at least one or two, I think there were
two before he had a job and then he had a job and a birthday party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That would have been October 18, would it not, approximately,
when he had a birthday party or represented to you that his birthday was
October 18?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; he may have celebrated the next day <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And your recollection is that you saw him each weekend after
that except for the weekend immediately prior to the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The weekend of November 8, 9, and 10 was a long weekend, was
it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. He was there then. I remember we didn't have a long weekend,
Bell didn't. He had another day to sit in front of the TV.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was that the last weekend that you saw him then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. If that is the one prior, two weekends, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now, starting at November 8, 9, and 10, which was the last
time you saw him, consider when your wife showed you the draft of the letter
that we spoke of just before. Would it have been that weekend or after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Well, I suppose it would be after that. They weren't in the house
when she showed it to me or at least he wasn't. I don't remember when he
wrote that letter or when we moved the furniture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't remember whether you saw Oswald after you read
the letter or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. That is a good question, I can see some point to it now. One
would surmise that, and I would think it reasonable that I would have looked
at him with somewhat different point of view after having read the letter, and
I don't remember looking at him with that different point of view, so quite possibly
I didn't see him again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So we would&mdash;the conclusion would be suggested that she
showed you the letter sometime after November 8 or 9, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; yes, I would guess that she, as I say, I would come to a dinner
when he was not there on either of the Tuesday or the Wednesday and that
would have been a reasonable time that she would have shown me the letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have a discussion with her about this subject of his
having gone to Mexico which was discussed in the letter, was it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. She thought it was a fabrication, a complete fabrication. And she
did not discuss, she gave me the letter, and as I say I was reading some other
magazine and I read the letter and went back to my magazine. How dense
people can be. But <span class="locked">anyway&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did <span class="locked">she&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. So we did not talk about it until later, then she took the letter
back and put it in an envelope or something, she didn't want me to see it. She
was sort of irked that I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Look at it when she wanted you to look at it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Pay more attention to this thing, yes. But she didn't want me
to see it again. "If you didn't see anything in it never mind looking at it."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did she tell you about any discussions she had with Marina
Oswald about Oswald's having been in Mexico?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I was under the impression that Ruth didn't know he had been
in Mexico until after the assassination and, therefore, and I think Ruth later
said, was dismayed also that Marina had been apparently, had apparently known
and deceived her in this matter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Well, did Ruth mention the fact that Marina had a little charm
made out of Mexican peso.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes; but we didn't put that two and two together there until the
FBI came and we looked on our drill press to see if they had used the tools in
the shop to mount the sights on the gun and we found these little metal filings
and then Ruth remembered that he had drilled out a coin to give to Marina and
she never&mdash;I can't remember whether she realized then that it was a peso or
Ruth hadn't thought that much about it until afterward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And you didn't discuss that subject prior to the assassination,
with your wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I didn't know about this whole thing, this medallion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did your wife mention the fact that Marina Oswald had a
record of Mexican music?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. No; I didn't know that until now. I don't recall it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did your wife tell you anything about the nature of her relationship
with Marina Oswald during this period from the first of October up to the
assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It all seemed perfectly reasonable to me. When Ruth had met
Marina back in the spring, I had seen that Marina Oswald&mdash;when I met them
in their apartment, Oswald had spoken very loudly and harshly to Marina, and
I thought to myself, isn't it amazing to see a little fellow who insists on wearing
the pants, strongly. And then later on in discussions which followed the discussion
which followed, that evening at the house, our house, he would not let
her have a contrary opinion, and I also saw she was allergic to gibes, and he
would gibe frequently.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. She was allergic to them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. It seemed to me so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. They affected her greatly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. Yes. This all went on in Russian, and I don't know what he was
saying. But I could see the object about which the statement was made, and
later Ruth also told me some of the things that he had said.</p>

<p>But I felt that he was keeping her a vassal, and since I was more eager to hear
her opinions of Russia than his opinions of Russia, I was eager that she should
learn English, and when&mdash;Ruth told me that Marina thought she must have to
go back to the Soviet Union, and I thought out of largesse of this country it
should be possible for her to stay here if she wanted to stay here and she quite
apparently did, she struck me as a somewhat apolitical person and yet true,
just, and conscientious, so it was agreeable to me to look forward to financing
her stay until she could make her own way here.</p>

<p>It added&mdash;Ruth also wanted to learn Russian, this was a cheap way for her
to learn Russian, than to pay tutoring. And, as it happened, it was costing me
less. She didn't go out shopping so much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When she was home learning Russian from Marina?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. When Marina was there to keep her company. She would go mad
with boredom, I would think. So that it&mdash;we were somewhat saddened, or I
think Ruth was, I think we shared&mdash;Ruth, of course, didn't want to stand in
the way of Marina and Lee if they were happy together, but would have been
glad to see Marina break away and make her own way. And she was a nice
companion for Ruth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any impression of how Marina and Ruth got along
together, what they did with their time during the day, that sort of thing?</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mr. Paine, you mentioned before these curtain rods that were
in your garage. Can you tell us approximately how many curtain rods there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span>
were in the garage when you last saw them and tell us when you last saw them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I saw them quite recently, 2 weeks ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How many curtain rods were there then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. There might be as many as four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Were there ever any more than that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. I don't believe so. These were normally up on the shelf above the
bench, and for some reason, they recently, I had to take them down, or something
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember seeing them shortly before November 22 at
any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Paine</span>. They never particularly impressed themselves on my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Those are all the questions I have.</p>

<h2 id="rfk">TESTIMONY OF RAYMOND FRANKLIN KRYSTINIK</h2>

<p>The testimony of Raymond Franklin Krystinik was taken at 9 a.m., on March
24, 1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Messrs. Albert E. Jenner, Jr. and Wesley J.
Liebeler, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Will you rise and raise your right hand? Do you solemnly
swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Mr. Krystinik, I am a member of the legal staff of the President's
Commission which has been established pursuant to Executive Order
11130, dated November 29, 1963.</p>

<p>Last week Mr. Rankin sent you a letter and told you that I would be in touch
with you, did he not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Enclosed with that letter were copies of the Executive Order
11130, and a copy of the Joint Resolution of Congress 137, and the rules of the
Commission's procedure in taking the testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You received those documents?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The general nature of our inquiry is to ascertain, evaluate
and report upon the facts relating to the assassination of President Kennedy
and the subsequent violent death of Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>We wish to inquire of you as to your knowledge of Oswald as a result of your
having met him, as we understand it, through Michael Paine prior to the assassination.
We also want to question you about some of the events that occurred
shortly after the assassination, and some conversation you had with Mr.
Paine at that time.</p>

<p>Would you state your name for the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Raymond Franklin Krystinik.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. 2121 Greenway Street, Arlington, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where do you work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Bell Helicopter Research Laboratory, located at 33006 Avenue
E, East, Arlington, Tex. It is a part of Bell Helicopter Co. Their address is
Box 482, Fort Worth, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long have you worked for Bell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Since June 6, 1960.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us briefly what your educational background is,
Mr. Krystinik?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. I started grade school in Caldwell, Tex. I moved to Bryan
and finished grade school in the Smetana School at Bryan, Tex. And from
there to Fredericksburg. At Fredericksburg I went to St. Mary's Catholic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span>
School and grade school, and from Fredericksburg to Grand Prairie, Tex. I
went to high school in Grand Prairie, Tex. Graduated in 1950.</p>

<p>I went to work for Chance Vought Aircraft Aviation from high school.
Went into the Navy in 1952, I believe. I don't remember exactly. I have
to look it up. I was married in 1954. Got out of the Navy in August of 1954.
Started to school at Arlington State College in September of 1954, and I graduated
from Arlington State in June of 1956.</p>

<p>Went to Texas A&amp;M, I think starting in January of 1957. I graduated from
Texas A&amp;M in June of 1960. On June 6, I went to work for Bell Helicopter.
These are just approximate dates. I think they are just about right, but I am
not right sure. If you need it, I can give you the exact dates.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This is all right. What kind of work do you do for Bell
Helicopter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. I am a research engineer. I work in the research group.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your work relates to helicopters and their design?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Actually right now; no. Right now, I am working on what
I think the company could classify as a flying machine. Is that adequate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Yes. When were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. August 31, 1932.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are you presently married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you have any children?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes; I have three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you know Michael Paine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. When did you meet him, approximately? And under what
circumstances?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Approximately in June of 1961, if I remember correctly. I
was assigned to the research group on a temporary assignment, and at the
research laboratory I met Michael and worked with him then off and on up
through now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are working with him now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did there come a time when you met Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. I went to a meeting of the American Civil Liberties Union
on the campus of SMU. I don't remember the date, except I do remember it
was the night after Mr. Stevenson's unhappy visit to Dallas when the lady, I
believe, swatted him with a placard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That was sometime in October of 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes; it was October of 1963. Oswald was at the meeting,
and Michael introduced me to him. He had told me about the man before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What had Michael Paine told you about Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. I mean told me that at the time there was a Russian lady
living with his wife Ruth and that just exactly, I can't remember his exact
words, but there was this fellow who was an ex-Marine who had defected to
Russia. I can remember that he told me that, that he defected to Russia, and
the fellow decided it wasn't for him and he came back to the United States. And
was, in general, a misfit and not capable of holding a good job; generally
dissatisfied, and didn't accept the responsibilities for his family, and Michael's
wife had taken Marina to help her for the time being.</p>

<p>That was the reference made to him prior to having met him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. To the best of your recollection, is that all Michael Paine told
you about Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. At that particular time we discussed him&mdash;during that period
of time Michael was eating supper with us on an average of once a week, and
we discussed the man as being odd, or at least a little different. Michael said
he couldn't understand the man exactly. He commented that he shirked or
ran from responsibilities. As long as he had money and had a job, he was
willing to stay around his family and support them, but when he lost a job
and didn't have the money, he apparently took off. I can remember him telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span>
me that about him, and when I met him at Selecman Hall, I didn't feel overly
happy to meet the man, or that I had made an acquaintance of value.</p>

<p>They were there before my wife and I came. As we walked in and sat down,
Oswald was there, and it didn't occur to me then that he might be the man.
Prior to the meeting starting, he introduced me to him.</p>

<p>Michael, I am referring to&mdash;Michael introduced me. I need to keep my chain
more correct, straight. Michael introduced me to Lee Oswald. As the meeting
started, about that time&mdash;before the meeting first there was a little bit of talk.
I don't remember what the chairman of the meeting said prior to the film
starting.</p>

<p>They showed a film about a Senator or Congressman or legislator, some form
of public servant who was running for reelection in Washington State, and
the far right people wanted him out in a campaign, stating that his wife had
connections with the Communist Party, and apparently she had had connections
during her college days but had severed relations with the party and had given
evidence to the FBI and an investigating team and apparently was clean at
the time, or had no connection with the party at the time. And they showed
in a film how the far right or an extremist movement could greatly damage
a citizen that was of value to the United States. That was the essence of the
film.</p>

<p>After the film there was discussion about the Civil Liberties and about the
film in general and about the movement in the South and the integration movement
and the talk concerning General Walker. The first notice I made of Oswald
is when he stood up and made a remark about General Walker in reference to
him not only being anti-Catholic but anti-Semitic in regard to his comments
about the Pope. Then he made further comments that a night or two nights
before he had been at the General Walker meeting here in Dallas. That was my
first real notice of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Oswald said to the assembled group at that time that he had
been to a meeting 2 days prior at which General Walker was present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. I think it was 2 days prior.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That meeting would have been just the night before Mr. Stevenson
came to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes, sir; I think, or it could have been the same night.
I don't remember the exact date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did Oswald say about General Walker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. That was it. That was his comment about Walker, and it
struck me at the time. I mean my ears perked up when he said Walker was
anti-Catholic in reference to his comments about the Pope. I can quote that.
That is exact. I am Catholic and I wanted to hear what he said. He didn't say
what General Walker had said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate any hostility toward General Walker either
by words or by his deeds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. At the time it seemed like Michael had commented to me prior
that the man was a Marxist, and I have never met anyone before that I had
known to be a Communist or a Marxist or Leninist or Red, and I was interested
mainly to see what the man looked like, how he thought and what he felt.
It seemed to me, in watching and listening to him, that rather than being violently
against General Walker, he was stirring in dirty thoughts that you
shouldn't like General Walker. He didn't say General Walker is a bad guy.
He just made comments that General Walker is anti-Semitic and anti-Catholic,
and he was spreading a little seed of thought. That was the way it impressed
me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You didn't get the feeling that Oswald had any particular
violent thoughts towards General Walker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. I didn't at this time. I had no idea he was violent until
I heard on the radio he had shot the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did anybody respond to Oswald's remarks about General
Walker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. There were other people that discussed it, and then they
discussed the bad display the people from the far right had put on when Mr.
Stevenson was in Dallas, and it was regrettable that extremists would act like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>
that. But any exact comment about General Walker I really don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald say anything about this Stevenson affair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. I couldn't say. I don't really remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you that he had been at the meeting at which
Stevenson had had his difficulty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. No, sir; he didn't tell me that. He told me, I think just
me he had mentioned, if I remember exactly, he had mentioned to Michael
and said, "I was there," in reference to the meeting of the General Walker group.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Are the remarks that you have told us about, the only remarks
that Oswald made to the entire group that evening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. The only ones I can remember and swear that I know was
the one in reference to General Walker not only being anti-Semitic but anti-Catholic
and in regard to his comment about the Pope.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald comment on the John Birch Society as well as
General Walker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. I know there was mention about him in the group. The
group commented on the John Birch Society, and I don't remember exactly
whether Oswald commented on them, too. I would like to be of help to you, but
I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Just give us the best recollection you have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. That is it so far.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How did Oswald impress you when he stepped up and addressed
the group? Did he impress you as being articulate, intelligent, or was he not
that way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. At that particular time he just made the one statement.
After the meeting, I talked to him for about 15 minutes primarily about
economics.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was anyone there besides you and Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes, sir; there was a Mr. Byrd Helligas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he take part in the conversation with you and Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes; a little bit, to the best of my memory. Oswald was the
fellow that impressed me, and I was paying attention to what he was saying,
and I am afraid that Mr. Helligas didn't make an impression on me. I don't
remember what he said, except he did enter into the conversation at different
times. I am afraid most of my attention was directed to Oswald. The hair was
up on the back of my neck. I was irritated by the man a little. Not real bad,
but he bothered me some.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was it what he said that bothered you, or was it his attitude?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Attitude more than exactly what he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What was his attitude?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Well, the attitude that I felt was that he was talking down
to me. I felt like he was. That he was better than I was, to a certain degree,
and he acted as if he had complete command of the argument and was on top
all the time. I felt that a couple of different spots in the argument I had him
practically beaten and he wouldn't accept my argument. He turned his back
and would go down a different avenue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He figuratively turned his back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes, sir; that is it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Reconstruct for us, as best you can, at this point, the discussion
that you and Oswald had. Tell us as best you can recall what he said and
what you said and what the argument was about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Well, after the meeting was over we went back to the back
where they had coffee. I believe they had doughnuts, I am not sure, but they
had a table of refreshments, at least, and I am sure there was coffee. I wasn't
interested in the coffee.</p>

<p>Michael, my wife, and Oswald, and I, walked to the back of the room together.
I approached Oswald and commented to him that Michael had told me
about his political background a little bit, and I understood that he had been
to Russia. I asked him what he felt communism had to offer that was better
than he could find in the United States. He kind of shrugged his shoulders and
didn't make any particular comment then.</p>

<p>I forget exactly the trend of talk at that particular moment, but as we talked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span>
for just a couple of minutes, or at any rate as we talked, I told him I had met
his wife at the Paine's over in Irving and that he had a beautiful little girl, he
should be real proud of them. And he commented, "They are nice." And that
was to let it go at that.</p>

<p>I forget, or I do forget now about exactly what the next few comments were.
We did start talking about communism versus capitalism. He said that in
capitalism the employer exploits the worker. I asked him just what he meant
by exploiting. He said he takes a man's labors and makes a profit from them
without actually putting in any effort of his own. I said that wasn't true. I
considered myself to be a capitalist, or at least to be a firm believer in the
capitalistic system. At the present time I had an employer and he paid me a
fair salary and I was real glad to work for him for the salary I got.</p>

<p>He commented that my employer was taking my efforts without putting in
any efforts and was reaping a profit from my efforts, and he wanted to know
if I thought that was fair or not?</p>

<p>And I said that I was happy. I am satisfied with what I have, and I feel
it is fair, and I used an analogy that in turn I am an employer. I have two
fellows who work for me building patterns for which I pay them $3 an hour
and they are tickled to get the $3 an hour. They are real glad to get it. And
that I make $4 an hour off of their efforts. My profit is $1 an hour, and that
I bought the machinery, I bought the material. I have gone out and hunted
up the work, and the $1 an hour from each of those two fellows is my wage
for going out and getting the work, and my wage is comparable to my
investment.</p>

<p>He said, you are exploiting labor. You are not doing any work. And he
commented then, well, that is all right for you. In your society it is not a
crime to exploit the worker. He didn't say, "to exploit the worker." He
said, "In your society it is not a crime." He was referring to exploitation of
the worker, supposedly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. That is really about all I remember from the conversation
itself. Oh, wait a minute, we did talk about freedom. I asked him what about
the freedom in Russia. And he said, "Well, they don't have as much actual
freedom." I have forgotten what he said exactly in reference to where they
didn't have the freedom. We were talking about actual civil liberties themselves
in the United States versus Russia. He said the United States by far
has more civil liberties.</p>

<p>I said, what do you think about the movement in the South in reference to
Mr. Kennedy? And he said he thinks that Kennedy is doing a real fine job, a
real good job, I have forgotten.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. So far as civil rights were concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes, sir. That was the only comment that was made in
reference to President Kennedy. I forget whether that was the only time he
expressed any emotion, and I have forgotten the exact words, he is doing a
real fine job, or very fine job. I can't remember exactly what he said.</p>

<p>He impressed me as having a lot of big words, and my immediate impression
was he was fairly well read, but talking with Michael later and recalling
the conversation later, it was pointed out, Michael brought it to my attention,
and after I think about it I agree with Michael, that he had available to him
a lot of two-bit vocabulary words, but not necessarily correctly used. This
was a later impression, but the immediate argument, I was interested in what
he was saying rather than how he was saying it and the way he had gone about
saying it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were particularly impressed, however, by the emphasis
that Oswald placed on his remark that President Kennedy was doing a good
job as far as civil rights were concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. At the immediate time I wasn't particularly impressed.
After the President was murdered, I felt that there was at least an emphasis
of note, if not connected. I do remember him saying, him placing emphasis on
the way he said it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And the impression you received of his attitude toward President
Kennedy was one of approval and one of favor?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">466</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. I would say yes. I don't know about President Kennedy
in general, how he felt, but in reference to the civil rights issue, the impression
I had was that he was favorably impressed by Mr. Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald express his attitude toward any other government
official, during the course of his conversation with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. I can't really remember. I have heard Michael Paine comment
that Oswald had at one time written a letter and left it laying around the
house, and that his wife, Ruth, had found this letter. It was in the typewriter.
I can't remember exactly the details, but that he had referred to the notorious
FBI. Apparently he didn't care for the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Michael tell you that before or after the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. It was after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. It was after?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Prior to the time of the assassination, however, you had no
feeling that Oswald had any particular hostility toward any government official
or toward the government in general? Would that be a fair statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. I can't really say because I don't know the exact time sequence.
After a little time is passed, it is hard to pin it down.</p>

<p>Michael and I discussed the man at length after the assassination, and we
talked about him a whole lot, so I don't really know whether it was before or
after, but I now feel that he was very definitely against all enforcement people
in general, and I don't know exactly when this impression came to me. But if
I didn't already have this impression beforehand, I certainly had it afterwards.</p>

<p>I do know that beforehand, that he didn't get along with his employers and
his fellow workers, or at least his employers, and he wasn't able to keep a
job, and he didn't have respect for his employers, and this might possibly extend
to law enforcement officials.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you feel that Oswald was, in general resentful of authority?
There was resentment of his employers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. According to Michael, talking to him, we didn't talk about
specifics, it was strictly generalities. It was 15 minutes that I talked to him,
or 15 minutes or so that I talked to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is this meeting that you had with Oswald in the ACLU, the
only meeting you ever had with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. That was the only time I saw him up until I saw him on
television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And your impressions are based upon your conversation with
him during that time at the ACLU meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Based on that and what Michael and I have discussed in
reference to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. In the course of the conversation with Oswald at the ACLU
meeting, did he tell you that he was a Marxist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes. It seems to me that I commented to him that, "You
are a Communist and I am a Capitalist," and I can't remember exactly what
it was, but he corrected me and he said, "I am a Marxist." When I addressed
him as a Communist, he said, "I am a Marxist."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He corrected you then when you said he was a Communist
and indicated he was not a Communist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ask him what the difference was between those theories?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. No; I don't remember having asked him that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. And he didn't elaborate on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald tell <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Oh, excuse me, there was one other thing that I, at the time
when he commented on the capitalistic system exploiting the worker, I came
back at him with the idea, you mean to tell me in Russia they don't exploit,
that the State doesn't exploit the worker, and he stated that it is worse than
here. He did say that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That the exploitation of the worker was worse in Russia than
it is in the United States?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. And the State exploited the worker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate to you any desire to return to the Soviet
Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he indicate any desire to go to any other country?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. To me; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you know at the time you talked to Oswald that he had
been active in the Fair Play for Cuba?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. No, sir; I never heard of the organization until I read about
it in the Dallas Morning News in reference to Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald tell you he was a member of any Marxist or
Communist group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. No. His only comment was that, "I am a Marxist."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any impression as to whether he was a member
of any group, Marxist or Communist group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. In reference to what Michael had told me that he defected
to Russia and that he claimed himself as being a Marxist, now I am afraid
that in my mind I felt he was a Communist or a Red, and my immediate impressions
were that even though he had nothing to offer me with which to place
trust in him, I didn't trust him and kind of considered him, I guess I looked at
him really like someone at a dog that might bite. I disliked the man. I disliked
him without him giving me personally an actual reason. I disliked him
before I met him on the basis of conversation with Michael. I disliked him
when I met him in that I felt he was talking down to me and felt he was somewhat
better than I was. He acted as he felt he had complete command of the
conversation, was leading it, and was controlling what was going to be said,
and I like to talk too.</p>

<p>We talked back and forth, but rather than a pleasant discussion, it was more
of an argument.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You got no impression at any time during the course of your
meeting with Oswald that he was an actual member of any Communist or
Marxist group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. I felt that he was, but that was only by saying, "I am a
Marxist." To me, that categorized him. But as to any specific organization, I
had no impression that he belonged to any specific group.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Oswald display any anger to you during the course of your
conversation with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. I can't remember, really. I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you now told us, to the best of your recollection, the entire
conversation that occurred between you and Oswald on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Only to the best of my recollection. I am sure that we talked
more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he mention anything to you about having been in the
Marines?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. He didn't. Michael had told me previously that he had been
in the Marines.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Had Michael told you that Oswald received an undesirable
discharge from the Marine Corps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But you didn't have any discussion about that with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any discussion with Oswald about his impressions
while he was in the Soviet Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. I did ask him to tell me about Russia, but then the conversation
diverged back into the economic end of the capitalism versus communism.
He commented that the work hours were long and the pay wasn't particularly
good. That was about the main thing. It was just that long in reference to
the Soviet Union and we were back to capitalism. He didn't seem to care to
talk particularly about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. His remarks about the pay and working conditions in the Soviet
Union were a general remark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Just general.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He didn't tell you how much he was paid or what kind of job
he had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Well, he didn't. Michael, I believe, told me afterwards, if
I remember correctly, that he was doing something in an electronic firm or
electrical industry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But Oswald himself told you nothing about his stay in the
Soviet Union other than you have already told us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Basically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What happened after the meeting was over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. As we were going out, I commented to Michael that we were
going to have to set this boy up in business and convert him. And he said that
the only thing he approached humor, he commented, "The money might corrupt
me." I can remember that as a quote.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. That is what Oswald said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. That is what Oswald said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He said that in a joking manner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. In a joking manner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Other than that, however, Oswald did not indicate any particular
sense of humor to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. No humor. He indicated no violence. He impressed me as
being cold. You can talk to some people and say they are warm and sincere.
He impressed me as being cold and stereotyped. He had fixed notions in his
head, and I had the impression he had his mind made up regardless of how good
an argument you presented. His mind was made up that he was not going to
admit, regardless of how strong it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you subsequently discuss with Michael Paine your argument
with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Prior to the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Prior to the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you tell us generally what you said and what Michael
said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Michael said that he knew of what was coming, so he went on
off and talked with my wife and with another fellow. There was no point in
him sticking around. He knew Oswald had a closed mind.</p>

<p>He didn't say, "closed mind." Michael is a rather unusual type of person.
He is careful not to overly, severely criticize anyone or make unkind comments
about other people, even though he himself has sensitive emotions and feels&mdash;you
have talked with him. I guess you have the same impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is that all that you and Michael said about your (conversation)
discussion with Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. With reference to this conversation, I related to him just about
what Oswald had said to me. It wasn't exactly in detail. I didn't talk about
him, as long about the actual conversation, as I have talked to you. He said
that he knew how it was going to go and there wasn't any point in his staying
around. He knew how Oswald would react.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He indicated to you that he had had previous similar
experiences?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did he tell you about this in specific detail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Only that he argued with him and the man loved to talk
economics, and that at first he was very, very interesting to talk to, but that once
the man had said all that he wanted to, or all that he was particularly interested
in, it was then a repeat, and that it was always all locked in in a small
little body, that he didn't particularly have any area for growth, that he had a
certain fixed image in his mind, and was reluctant to have it improved or
changed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Michael indicate to you that Oswald received any periodicals
or literature concerning economic or social and political questions of the time
that you discussed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Prior to the assassination, no, he didn't. I am trying to&mdash;I
forget now exactly&mdash;I have read the newspapers and I heard so darn much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">469</a></span>
about it on the radio and television, it is actually hard to strain out exactly
who said what. I know that he had gotten Communist literature, and I can't
remember whether it was from Michael or from the news media that I heard this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you recall any other discussions between Michael Paine
and yourself, concerning Lee Oswald that occurred prior to the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. No, sir; not really.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The occasion that you met Oswald at the ACLU meeting was
the only time at which you ever met Oswald, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You mentioned that you had met Marina Oswald and child
prior to that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes; Michael had bought an old blue&mdash;he had a French
Citroen automobile. At any rate, he had the two cars and he wanted me to
drive either his car home or follow him home in my car. And he was taking
the Oldsmobile to Irving and I followed him in my car and took him back to
the research laboratory and picked up his Citroen. At any rate, when I drove
the car in, he went into the house and brought Ruth out and Marina. And
all I remember is one little girl. I didn't see the baby. The little girl came
out with her mother and Ruth introduced me to Marina. She impressed me
at the time as very sweet and very polite. I spoke as slowly and as distinctly
as I could to her in English, Texan to be exact, and she turned to Marina&mdash;Marina
turned to Ruth and spoke to her in Russian, and I asked Ruth if I was
talking too fast, and Marina said I am talking too Texan.</p>

<p>At any rate, that was about it. I told her that she had a beautiful little
girl and hoped that she would like the United States. And she commented
that she did, that it was a wonderful country. That I can remember for sure.
That impressed me, because it seems that where there is a possibility of a
Russian saying something nice, it is nice to have a compliment. At least I
felt complimented.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Marina indicated that to you in English, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. I can't remember whether it was the words, but that was
the way I took it to be. It was my thinking, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Marina understand the remarks that you had made to
her in English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Apparently she followed the trend, but she turned to Ruth
for exact interpretation, and Ruth told me that I wasn't talking too fast, just
too Texan. That was Marina's comment.</p>

<p>At first I was talking just to Marina back and forth, and she said just
a few words, and I asked her how old the child was, and if I remember exactly,
2 or 3. I have forgotten. But one- or two-word answers, and I had no trouble
at all understanding her up to that point. When Ruth entered into the conversation,
she turned and relied directly and totally upon Ruth. I talked to her
only about 5 minutes in all. I talked with her while Ruth was looking at the
car with Michael. I mean I talked to her rather than with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This was after Marina had given birth to the second child.
Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes; seemed like only a week or 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was there any discussion of Lee Oswald at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. No, sir; his name wasn't mentioned. I hadn't met him at
that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you ever met Lyman Paine? That would be Michael's
father. Did you ever discuss Lyman Paine with Michael?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Only once. We talked about him a couple of times, but
one time Michael, just prior to Michael buying the land in Irving for his
future shop.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you tell us approximately when that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. No, sir; I can't remember, but it was about a week prior
to his buying the land.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. I can fix the time. He had commented that he had been
invited by his father to the west coast for the weekend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">470</a></span>
I know that the previous time Michael had been saving his money to buy
this land, and I feel that he didn't have enough money at the time, and he
flew out on a Friday evening, if I remember correctly, and flew back to Dallas
early Monday morning, and he was sleepy and tired at work that day. We
talked and I asked him if he had a nice time visiting with his father, and
he commented that he had a nice time and that his father had a very nice
party. And it seemed this was somewhat of an international party. He talked
about this Negress that he had met who was extremely interesting. Her husband
had written a book on labor, and he talked mainly about this woman
and the conversation he had with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. This conversation occurred at a party that Lyman Paine had
given in Los Angeles is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes; that's right. He didn't tell me in detail why he was
particularly interested. He said she was a very interesting person, and that
he had talked to a group of other people, several other people. He said that
there was a man from West or East Germany, and I remember he said that
there were some Chinese people there, and I don't remember whether they
were or were not from the Communist bloc. I don't remember that. But he
commented on several other people that were, in my book, I would say they
were each one an extremist of some form or other at the time&mdash;at the time that
he was telling me about them. They were at least very different than you would
meet on the street. That doesn't make them bad, don't misunderstand me.
That was the impression I had. He didn't say they were Communist or bad
people or anything like that. They were just very, very different.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Michael indicate to you that his father had been active
in the affairs of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. No; he didn't. I asked him what his father did, and he
said he was an architect, and that was the comment. It seemed there was
some mention made about a Communist or a fellow that had communistic interests
being at the party, and I asked him what kind of people does your father
associate with. He said he didn't know really what his father does. That was
his comment. He didn't know what his father does, that he really knows that
he is an architect and that is about it. That was Michael's comment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you ask him what kind of a man his father was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. No, sir; not really. I talked to him about it very little, and
I do know that just shortly after he came back from Los Angeles, Michael did
buy this plot of land and he did pay cash, $3,000, and I had the impression that
prior to his going to Los Angeles he didn't have the money.</p>

<p>I had that impression because he commented that there was time for him
to pay or give&mdash;we were talking about church donations during the coffee break
one day shortly after that, and he commented that he was really going to have
to do something about his bank account, it was time to pay his pledge dues at
the Unitarian Church and he didn't have the money in the bank, and 3 or so
weeks later he had $3,000, for a plot of land, so I am assuming, I am not a
detective, that he had gotten the money from his father or from Art Young, who
is his stepfather. One of those two persons, he had gotten the money. He had,
if I remember correctly, Art Young was in Texas, so one of these two places he
had gotten the money. Those are the impressions I had, that he had gotten it
from his father.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have any discussion about this with Michael?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. No, sir; I didn't. I want to make it clear that I don't know.
These are impressions that I had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Michael tell you that he went to Los Angeles for the purpose
of visiting his father?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. No, sir; he didn't state it in that way. He said that his
father offered to pay for the plane ticket to the west coast, and he thought
it was a wonderful opportunity to visit his father, and this was the discussion
prior to his leaving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He was not sent to the west coast on business for Bell Helicopter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. No, sir; he has been sent to Pennsylvania on Bell Helicopter
business. I am aware of that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">471</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But so far as you know, he was not sent to Los Angeles on
Bell Helicopter business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. No, sir; so far as I feel that if he had, that he would have
told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You are a friend of Michael Paine's?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. I would like to consider myself a friend of his, and by my
telling you things, I feel that I am still a friend of his. I think that he is&mdash;I
feel that he has absolutely nothing to hide, and in all honesty, I don't feel that
what I tell you can in any way hurt him, and if it would hurt him, he has been
going&mdash;he has been doing something he shouldn't have been doing, and if he
has, why we need to know about it, because that is just the way I feel. I don't
feel like I am squealing on him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did Michael tell you that his father had called him shortly
after the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. No, sir; he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As far as you know, the last contact Michael had with his
father is when he went to Los Angeles shortly prior to the time he bought this
tract in Irving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes, sir; that is the last comment he made to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Where were you when you learned that fact that the President
had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. At the research laboratory. We were listening to the radio.
We had listened to the President's speech from the Texas Hotel parking lot
in Fort Worth. I think that almost every one at the laboratory honestly really
liked President Kennedy and was all for him. We were much interested in
him whenever he did make a speech. I believe during working hours we always
listened to his speech, and we were listening to the radio at the time.
When the first report came in, they had been talking about the motorcade
through downtown Dallas, and switched to the Market Hall, and the commentator
was talking from the Market Hall, and the first comment there, was
a report that there was shots fired at the President. And he didn't say he had
been hit.</p>

<p>Then there was some discussion on the radio, and then it came through,
this is official that the President of the United States has been fired at by an
assassin or an attempted assassination. And in a little while it came through
he had been hit and taken to Parkland Hospital, and the reports were that
he and Governor Connally were both hit and both considered to be in serious
condition. And it came through that they were both alive but both in extremely
critical condition. And finally, I think it was about an hour later
the report came through the President had expired. And Michael exhibited
real outward emotion. He had his back turned and his head was down slightly
and he really cried. And I don't feel that Michael is the type that could make
crocodile tears in seriousness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was Michael with you when you first heard of the fact that the
President had been fired at?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes, sir; we were all in the lab in the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you eat lunch with Michael that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. No, sir; I didn't. I don't think I did. I do eat with him
quite often off and on. Most of the time I stay at the lab and drink my can
of Metrecal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. To the best of your knowledge, you did not eat with Michael?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. I recall I did not that day, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. But also to the best of your recollection, you were both in
the lab?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. We were both in the office portion of the lab. Michael has
a stereo hi-fi that he brought to the lab for use by all of us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You were there at that time when you first heard that the
President had been fired at?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. And immediately when the first report came in that the
President had been fired at, three or four of us, I forget them, myself, Michael
Paine, Ken Sambell, and Clarke Benham all gathered right around the radio
like a bunch of ticks and stayed there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Was Mr. Noel there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Dave Noel, yes; I believe he was. I believe Dave was the
one that went to dinner with Michael, if I am correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He went to lunch with Michael?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. As best you can recall, you had not heard anything about
the attempted assassination prior to the time Michael and Dave returned from
lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. No; we were listening on the radio and heard the report.
As far as being shot at, I can't remember exactly whether Michael was there
when the very, very first report came in, but he was there when the report
came in. He was there when the report came in that he had died.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you and Michael have any conversations about the
assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes; we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Tell us to the best of your recollection what he said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. I commented, "Who in the blue-eyed world would do a
thing like that?" And if I remember right, Michael didn't make any immediate
comment at all about the assassination other than what a terrible
thing and what in the world could he gain. We commented, first immediate
impression was that possibly the John Birch people would have had a grievance
against him, possibly, and we talked about that.</p>

<p>And Michael said he didn't know. He wouldn't expect that the Communists
would do it, yet at the same time he wouldn't expect the John Birch people
to do it and wouldn't know. Then the first report came through that he had
been fired at from Elm and Houston Streets in that area, and at that time
Michael commented that, well, that is right close to the Texas School Book
Depository.</p>

<p>I did remember prior to the assassination Michael telling me that Oswald
had finally gotten a job and he was working at the Texas School Book Depository,
and at that particular time right then, I said, "You don't think it could be
Oswald?" And he said, "No, it couldn't be him." At any rate, he had the
same impression I had, that none of us could really believe it was a person
they had met. It was such a big thing that a person doesn't imagine himself
having met a person that could do such an act.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Your first discussion with Michael on the question of Oswald's
possible involvement in the assassination came after you had learned that the
shots were fired in the vicinity of Elm and Houston near the Texas School Book
Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes; he commented about Elm and Houston, and he said
that is where the Texas School Book Depository is, and the next comment was I
commented, "Well isn't that where Oswald works?" And he says, "That is where
he works." And I said, "Do you think it could be him?" And he said, "No; he
doesn't see any way in the world it could have been him." But it wasn't but
just a little <span class="locked">bit&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Let me interrupt you for a moment. You were the first one
to mention Oswald's name in connection with the assassination between you
and Michael Paine, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes, sir; everyone was standing around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Why did you think of Oswald's name in connection with the
assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. I guess mainly because the first time I had heard of the
Texas Book Depository was, Michael told me Oswald had gotten a job there.
And when he said Texas Book, that was perhaps the second time I had ever
heard the name. I don't know that I actually knew they had one. And when
he said Texas Book Depository, it immediately rang right back. And I said,
"That's where Oswald works."</p>

<p>And I didn't think of Oswald shooting the President at that time. I just
commented that was where he works. And then my next comment, "You don't
think it could be him?" And he said, "No; of course not, it wouldn't be him."
And it wasn't but just a little while later that we heard that Officer Tippit
had been shot, and it wasn't very long after that that it came through that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">473</a></span>
the Oswald fellow had been captured, had had a pistol with him, and Michael
used some expression, I have forgotten exactly what the expression was, and
then he said, "The stupid," something, I have forgotten. It wasn't a complimentary
thing. He said, "He is not even supposed to have a gun."</p>

<p>And that I can quote, "He is not even supposed to have a gun." Or, "Not
even supposed to own a gun," I have forgotten.</p>

<p>We talked about it a little bit more, about how or why or what would the
reasons be behind, that he would have absolutely nothing to gain, he could hurt
himself and the nation, but couldn't gain anything personal, and we discussed it.</p>

<p>That immediately ruled out the John Birch, but why would the Communists
want him dead, and Michael couldn't imagine whether it was a plot or a rash
action by the man himself. He didn't know which it could be. He said he
didn't know. And he called home then to Ruth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Before we get into that, you specifically remember that Michael
said that Oswald was not even supposed to have a gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes, sir; I remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Do you remember those exact words?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes. He could have said, "Oswald doesn't own a gun." That
could be. That could be. The exact thing is cloudy a little bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What is your best recollection on the point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. My best recollection is, "He is not supposed to have a gun,"
or something in that vicinity. That is the best I remember right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you have the <span class="locked">impression&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Now that you mentioned to me that he isn't supposed to own
that gun, it is possible that he did say that, but the way I remember is that
he said "He is not supposed to have a gun."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you get the impression at that time that Michael had any
foreknowledge of Oswald's possible involvement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. None at all. I felt it hit him as a big shock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Now you said that you were the first one to mention Oswald's
name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The basic reason you mentioned it was because you had associated
his name with the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Is there any other reason why you thought of Oswald in connection
with the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Oh, it might possibly be; I can't really tell you, it was all
just everything was going that way, and it was a trying thing of oppression and
worry at that particular time.</p>

<p>It may be that he is the only Communist I have ever been introduced to,
that I knew was possibly a Communist or Marxist, or whatever they are, and
he was the only villain I could think of at the time, possibly. And I didn't
really feel that he was a villain. I didn't really feel it was him, but he was
the only person I knew connected with the Communist Party, and if the Communist
Party should be associated with something, his was the name that
came to my mind, possibly.</p>

<p>I feel the correlation came through the fact that Michael had told me about
him getting a job at the Texas School Depository, and when I heard the name
again, I feel that was the correlation that brought his name to my mind. A
lot of these things, I don't know where or how they come to mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. After you heard that Oswald had been apprehended in connection
with the slaying of Officer Tippit, did you and Michael Paine then
associate Oswald with the assassination of the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. I did, and I feel that Michael did also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did you and Michael say to each other just very shortly
after the word had come through?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. I can't really remember. Michael said that he felt that he
should be going home, that Ruth and Marina are both going to be muchly upset
and there was going to be people at the house asking questions, and he felt he
should be there to answer them. He did say, if I can answer, "I feel I should
be there."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">474</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He said that prior to the time that Oswald had been publicly
connected with the assassination, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. I just really don't know. Prior to Oswald's being apprehended,
there was a description of the man on the radio, if I remember correctly,
and the shot had been&mdash;it had been reported that&mdash;can we go back just
a little bit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. More of this is coming back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Surely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. At the time the radio had commented that the shots had
come from the vicinity of the Texas School Book Depository, and they put out
a description of a young man. After I had asked Michael about the possibility
of Oswald, well, he commented that that is where Oswald works.</p>

<p>Then they put out the description of the young man, and I said that fits him
pretty good, to the best of my memory. You don't think it could have been
him? They did put out the description prior to his arrest and prior to his
having shot Officer Tippit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The description seemed to fit Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. The description seemed to fit Oswald, and they did at that
time, if I remember, comment on him being about 25 years old. I think that
was the age they gave, weighing about 160 pounds, and being sandy head, and
if I remember right, they said a fair complexion. I don't remember that part
of it. And shortly, just a little while after that, they commented on Officer
Tippit having been shot and Oswald having been arrested in the Texas Theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you discuss with Michael the possibility that the description
given fitted Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes; I did. I said it sounds like him. Do you think we
should call the FBI. And he said, "Let's wait a little bit." And at that particular
time he said that he didn't see any way in the world it could be Oswald
at all. Besides, the man was in Oak Cliff, and Oswald was&mdash;works in the
School Book Depository.</p>

<p>They commented on the radio there was a man fitting this description and
having shot Officer Tippet in Oak Cliff, and being shot. They commented on
Tippit, and they were after him, and it was after they arrested him in the Oak
Cliff Theatre.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. The description of this individual was given out after Officer
Tippit had been shot, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. It seems that someone had seen him shoot Officer Tippit. I
don't remember that for sure, the description was on the radio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. What did Michael say when you suggested that he call the
FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. He said, "If it is him, there is nothing they could do right
now. It seems they are right after him. He didn't see in any way in the world
it could be him. He didn't believe that it could be him."</p>

<p>And then just a little bit after that, I can't remember time spans, that was
a pretty bad day&mdash;when I first heard about it having been Oswald, to the
best of my recollection, the thing he said was that, "He is not even supposed
to have a gun." He may have been meaning to the best of his knowledge, he
didn't know that he owned a gun. That would have been what he meant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did it seem strange to you at the time that Michael didn't want
to advise the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. No; it didn't at all. We had talked about&mdash;Michael is a
little, I couldn't call him an odd duck, but he is very different. He doesn't
like to intrude on anyone's personal privacy at all, I mean, the least little bit.</p>

<p>I can be making a telephone conversation to my wife or to the company on
business, and he is very careful not to come into the office, and he will see me on
the telephone and turn around and go back. He is very careful to afford to
other people all the privacy that he can.</p>

<p>At the same time, we commented before when I had seen a fellow taking
movies of the Chance Vought FAU 3 Crusader from the road above a railroad
embankment just north of the naval air station, of the 11735 and I was a
little bit wrangled about it and accosted the man did he&mdash;if he couldn't read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">475</a></span>
signs, that that was an&mdash;that was a United States Government reservation and
no photographs permitted, and he said he was recording the historical information
of the aircraft for the future.</p>

<p>It seems that no one is actually doing this and he was claiming this date and
time that the FAU 3 was a fairly new airplane. And I don't know that taking
that picture would hurt. There have been pictures of it in Aviation Week.
It still wrangled me that someone would be taking pictures when there were
signs up saying not to, and I accosted him, and I got his name. And I felt that
he was probably lying to me, and I got his license number of his car, also.</p>

<p>The next day while they were discussing the situation at work, and Michael
said, regardless of the signs there, that he was standing in a public right-of-way,
and anything that could be photographed from the public right-of-way he could
technically, regardless of what the signs said on the fence.</p>

<p>If it is something super secret, they should maintain a security check and
faithfully check it out.</p>

<p>I asked him if he thought I should go ahead and call the FBI or the security
officer at the naval air station. He said, I could do what I wanted. He certainly
wouldn't tell me not to. Yet at the same time it was entirely possible
that the guy was a nut and doing exactly what he said he was doing, and we
might cause him a lot of inconvenience and a lot of unhappiness by hollering
wolf when the man had done nothing wrong. He said it would be better had
I gone ahead at the time and had him arrested on the spot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You think that Michael's attitude toward calling the FBI
in connection with Oswald's involvement was similar to the attitude that you
explained in the situation you have just described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes; and at the same time it still is his attitude. A fellow
ran into the back of his Citroen and damaged it. And I said, "Well, you got
his name, serial, license number and so forth?" And he said, "No, the man
said that he would pay for it." I said, "Did you call the police in the event
he sues you for a broken neck?" He said, "No, I take a man at his word."</p>

<p>He exhibited that several times to assume him to be honest until you have
good reason or absolute proof positive. He would have to see in his mind that
the man had done it before he actually would bring forth civilly, because he
would feel that the man was actually going to sue him before he would take
measures to even protect himself. As it worked out, I don't know whether the
man ever paid for fixing the back end of his car, because he drove it that way
for a long time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Have you talked to Michael since he returned from Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Did you discuss the testimony that he gave the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Only in that he said that he felt that he didn't give them
anything that was news to them, that he said he told them about the same
thing he told the FBI and other people that had talked to him. He felt that
he hadn't earned his plane ticket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He didn't discuss any of the details of the testimony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. No, sir; none of the details.</p>

<p>At any rate, I did call the Security Officer and the naval air station in
Dallas, and as it worked out, the fellow had been working for himself&mdash;seems he
is out every Saturday and Sunday and that he had been checked out and is
apparently a nut, rather than a Communist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Can you think of anything else that you think the Commission
should know about in connection with the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Nothing in connection with the assassination.</p>

<p>In connection with Michael, I would almost stake my reputation on his
apparent honesty. I feel he is as good, I think, in his heart as he is on the
surface.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't think he had anything to do with the events leading
up to the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. I don't feel that he had anything to do with it. I think if
he had been of a more suspicious nature, he could possibly have avoided the
President being shot.</p>

<p>He told me after the President was killed and after it had come out that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span>
the rifle had possibly been stored at his home, that he had moved in his garage
some sort of heavy object about this long wrapped up in a blanket, and he had
the impression when he moved it this was some sort of camping equipment,
and that it was considerably heavier than camping equipment he had been
dealing with, and it never occurred to him it might be a gun or rifle that had
been broken down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Would you indicate approximately how long the package was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. He said something about like that [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How long would you say that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Looking at it, I would say 26 or 28 inches. Maybe 30 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. [Measuring]. The witness indicates a length of approximately
27 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Michael might have had his hands up 2 or 3 inches different
from that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. To the best of your recollection, Michael indicated the length of
about 27 inches?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. He told you that he did not suspect at any time prior to the
assassination that this package contained a rifle, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. That's correct. Or a gun. He didn't state rifle in reference
to the weapon.</p>

<p>Michael had commented briefly that he had never had a gun or would not have
a gun in his house. He is opposed. I would assume he is opposed to killing
men. I know he is opposed to killing animals, and he doesn't believe in violence
at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Aside from this remark that you made about Michael Paine, is
there anything else that you can think of that you would like to tell us in connection
with either the assassination or Michael Paine at this point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Nothing I can think of now. I have taken enough of your
time. I can't really think of anything that is concrete from beginning to end that
I feel would help you. I don't know of anything that is important.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. How well do you know Ruth Paine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. We have been to her house once. We have been to the Dallas
Dollar Concert with he and Ruth one time. We have had her at our house twice.
Actually I can't say that I know her real well. I feel that I know Michael fairly
well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. You don't really know Ruth well? Well enough to make any
judgment about her character?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Only when I have talked to her, I had an impression I have
been talking to an extremely sincere and very warm person.</p>

<p>I felt that if she had done something, she is of such a type she would say,
"I did it." That is the impression I have about her. I don't know her well
enough to make judgment upon her. I don't know Michael well enough to judge
him. All I know of him is the association I had with him at work and the little
bit I have had with him in my home. I don't actually know what he does on his
off time, but in my association with him at work and what I know of him at
home, I have actually come to love him as much as I love my brother.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. Based upon your knowledge of both of the Paines, you have no
reason to suspect them of any involvement of any kind in the assassination, do
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Only as victims of a very cruel twist of fate, that is all I can
say, and that they are in that position because of their charity. I think it is a
vexatious, cruel reward for charity, to be associated with the people, or to harbor
the wife of the assassin&mdash;I won't say harbor&mdash;I don't say she had anything to
do with it. Michael told me that Oswald visited the Paine residence on weekends.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Liebeler</span>. I don't have any more questions at this time. Unless you have
something else you want to add we shall terminate the questioning. Thank you,
Mr. Krystinik.</p>

<p>Let me indicate that the witness is willing to waive signature of the transcript,
is that so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Krystinik</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<h2><a name="Transcribers_Notes" id="Transcribers_Notes">Transcriber's Notes</a></h2>

<p>Punctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant
preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.</p>

<p>Misspellings in quoted evidence not changed; misspellings that could be
due to mispronunciations were not changed.</p>

<p>Some simple typographical errors were corrected.</p>

<p>Inconsistent hyphenation of compound words retained.</p>

<p>Ambiguous end-of-line hyphens retained.</p>

<p>Occasional uses of "Mr." for "Mrs." and of "Mrs." for "Mr." corrected.</p>

<p>Occasional periods that should be question marks not changed.</p>

<p>Occasional periods that should be commas, and commas that should be
periods, were changed only when they clearly had been misprinted (at
the end of a paragraph or following a speaker's name in small-caps at
the beginning of a line). Some commas and semi-colons were printed so
faintly that they appear to be periods or colons: some were found and
corrected, but some almost certainly remain.</p>
